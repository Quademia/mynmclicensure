## Session — 2026-04-26 (Slice 2.8 — Admin nav scaffold — Claude Web + Desktop)

Final nav scaffold slice. Admin sidebar with 15 permission-gated
items, collapsible "Bank ▾" sub-nav, "Visible items" footer counter,
list pages only (detail subtrees follow list-vs-detail-as-siblings
when their feature work lands).

### Architecture

`(app)/admin/layout.tsx` reverted from slice 2.6's AppShell wrap to
a slim ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN role gate (mirrors slice 2.7 tutor revert).
Each admin sub-folder owns its chrome via `<AdminShell>` — a Server
Component that calls `loadChromeData()`, fetches the user's
`nclex_admin_permissions` rows, filters `ADMIN_NAV` via
`filterAdminNav()`, and renders `<AppShell productLabel="· Admin">`
with the filtered sidebar.

The sidebar component is its own file (`components/nav/admin/sidebar.tsx`)
mirroring the tutor global sidebar pattern (FlatRow + ParentRow split
to keep React-hook order stable). Adds `.sidebar-content` wrapper +
`.sidebar-footer` for the "Visible items: N of 15" counter; tutor and
student sidebars unchanged because they don't render the wrapper.

### Route moves

- `admin/bank/page.tsx` → `admin/bank/all/page.tsx` (bank list); new
  `admin/bank/page.tsx` redirects to `/admin/bank/all`
- `admin/trends/{page, new/page, [trend_id]/page}.tsx` →
  `admin/bank/trends/{...}` (mirrors slice 2.7 tutor move)
- `admin/page.tsx` was a ~150-line section-menu page; replaced with a
  4-line redirect to `/admin/dashboard`. The old SECTIONS array,
  viewingAs derivation, and section-card filter all die — the sidebar
  IS the section menu now

Reference updates: `BASE_URL`s, focus-mode redirect for trend
children, "Trend datasets →" header card href, "Back to bank" links,
`lib/bank/list-view.tsx` admin URL builder, `lib/bank/trend/editor.tsx`
admin baseUrl, `lib/bank/trend/actions.ts` admin surfaceConfig
baseUrl, `admin/bank/actions.ts` baseUrl (admin surface), and
`admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` cancelHref default — all flipped to
`/admin/bank/all` or `/admin/bank/trends`. Permission-fail redirects
across 7 existing admin pages (`/admin` → `/admin/dashboard`) — single-
hop to skip the redirect chain.

### Files created (Phases 2–5)

- `lib/nav/admin.ts` — `ADMIN_NAV` (15 items, dropdown on Bank) +
  `filterAdminNav` helper. Spec-to-code permission mapping (dotted
  spec form → SCREAMING_SNAKE code keys) documented at the top.
- 8 new icons added to `components/nav/shared/nav-icon.tsx`: `tutor`,
  `apply`, `tag`, `flag`, `mail`, `alert`, `shield`, `settings`. Paths
  copied verbatim from `admin-nav.html`'s mockup. Spec icon for
  Programmes (`calendar`) and Readiness Packs (`target`) reuse
  existing entries — no new icon needed.
- `lib/nav/types.ts` — `NavItem` gained optional `permission?: string | null`
  (with sentinel `'SUPER_ADMIN'` for role-only gating).
- `components/nav/admin/sidebar.tsx` — admin sidebar with footer
  counter (FlatRow + ParentRow split, same pattern as
  `components/nav/tutor/global-sidebar.tsx`).
- `components/nav/admin/admin-shell.tsx` — Server Component shell
  helper.
- `app/(app)/admin/{dashboard, packs, users, tutors, applications,
  programmes, enrolments, products, reports, enquiries,
  announcements, permissions, config}/page.tsx` — 13 placeholder
  pages, each with its own permission gate.
- `app/(app)/admin/{dashboard, bank, packs, users, tutors,
  applications, programmes, enrolments, payments, products, reports,
  enquiries, announcements, permissions, config}/layout.tsx` — 15
  thin layout files, each renders `<AdminShell>{children}</AdminShell>`.
- `styles/nav.css` — `.sidebar` refactored to flex column (so admin
  footer pins at bottom; tutor + student sidebars look unchanged
  since they don't render `.sidebar-content`); added
  `.sidebar-content`, `.sidebar-footer`, `.sidebar-footer-label`,
  `.sidebar-footer-value`.

### Files edited

- `app/(app)/admin/layout.tsx` — reverted to slim role gate
- `app/(app)/admin/page.tsx` — section-menu page replaced with redirect
- 7 existing admin pages — perm-fail redirects flipped to
  `/admin/dashboard` (single-hop after the `/admin` redirect change)
- `mynclex/CLAUDE.md` — new 8th folder-conventions rule documenting
  SCREAMING_SNAKE for permission keys
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/admin-nav.html` — build-note callout
  explaining the SCREAMING_SNAKE convention + the route moves

### Decisions captured

- **Cases keep short slug at `/admin/bank/cases/`**, mirroring tutor.
  Sidebar label is "Case Studies"; URL slug is `cases`.
- **Sidebar code stays audience-isolated.** Admin gets its own
  `components/nav/admin/sidebar.tsx` rather than generalising the
  tutor sidebar. Generalisation can land after a 4th audience
  consumer proves the abstraction is stable.
- **Net-new icons = 8** (handoff said 11). Spec uses `calendar` for
  Programmes (not `briefcase`), `apply` for Enrolments (not `link`),
  and the `pack` SVG is identical to existing `target` — kept
  `target` and skipped the alias.
- **Detail subtrees deferred.** `/admin/user/[id]/...` and friends
  land per-feature when the real pages need them; the list-vs-detail
  sibling rule from slice 2.7 fix applies.
- **Permissions page = SUPER_ADMIN role only**, not a permission
  bucket. The page that grants other admins their buckets isn't a
  bucket itself.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean
- `npx eslint app components lib` — clean
- `npm run build` — clean (route count grew significantly, see
  build output)
- Browser preview: dev server boots, middleware bounces unauthed
  `/admin/dashboard` to `/login`. Authed flow needs Sam's session.

### What's unblocked

- Three audience nav scaffolds complete (student, tutor, admin).
- Each admin section (Users, Tutors, etc.) can build out its real
  page + detail subtree following the established pattern.
- Real admin permissions UI (the dropping placeholder under
  `/admin/permissions`) is the natural next admin work.

### Next session

Sam-driven — pick the next admin feature or unrelated work.

## Session — 2026-04-26 (Slice 2.7 fix — programme route split — Claude Web + Desktop)

Bug shipped yesterday: visiting any programme detail URL
(`/tutor/programmes/[id]/overview` etc.) rendered TWO topbars and
TWO footers stacked. Root cause: the file tree had
`programmes/layout.tsx` wrap the list AND
`programmes/[programme_id]/layout.tsx` wrap the detail, both nested
under the same parent — Next.js layouts always nest, so both
`<AppShell>` instances rendered on a detail URL.

The structural fix: list and detail are conceptually sibling worlds
(entering a programme is a context switch, not a drill-down), so the
file tree needs to express that. Split into singular vs plural:
- `tutor/programmes/` (plural) — list, global chrome, no children.
- `tutor/programme/[programme_id]/` (singular) — detail subtree,
  programme chrome.

### Changes

- 9 files moved: `tutor/programmes/[programme_id]/{layout,page,
  overview,weeks,sessions,mocks,assignments,students,results}` →
  `tutor/programme/[programme_id]/{...}`
- `lib/nav/tutor.ts` `TUTOR_PROGRAMME_NAV` — 7 hrefs flipped from
  `/tutor/programmes/:programmeId/...` to
  `/tutor/programme/:programmeId/...`
- `tutor/programmes/page.tsx` — demo card hrefs now point at
  `/tutor/programme/${id}/overview`
- `tutor/programme/[programme_id]/page.tsx` — internal redirect now
  targets `/tutor/programme/${id}/overview`
- Stale comments updated in `programme-sidebar.tsx`,
  `tutor/programmes/layout.tsx`, `tutor/layout.tsx`, and the
  `tutor-nav.html` route-shape block
- `tutor-nav.html` — added a second build-note callout explaining
  the singular/plural decision
- `CLAUDE.md` — added a 7th folder-conventions rule documenting the
  list-vs-detail sibling pattern, so the admin scaffold inherits it

Old URLs `/tutor/programmes/[id]/...` 404 — clean break, only Sam
used them.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean
- `npx eslint app components lib` — clean
- `npm run build` — clean
- Dev preview: `/tutor/programmes` renders single global chrome,
  `/tutor/programme/demo-bootcamp/overview` renders single
  programme chrome (no double topbar).

### Implication for the admin slice

The `(app)/admin/layout.tsx` from slice 2.6 still renders an
`<AppShell>` directly. The admin scaffold needs to (a) revert it to
a slim role gate, and (b) follow the list-vs-detail sibling pattern
established here for any admin surface where entering a detail
changes the chrome.

---

## Session — 2026-04-25 (Slice 2.7 — Tutor nav scaffold — Claude Web + Desktop)

Tutor navigation end-to-end: global sidebar (Programmes / My Bank ▾ /
My Students / Payments / Profile), programme-scoped sidebar with back
pill (Overview / Weeks / Sessions / Mocks / Assignments / Students /
Results), collapsible "My Bank" dropdown wired to the existing tutor
bank list + case-study list + trend list pages. Two hardcoded demo
programme cards make the programme context reachable for browser
verification.

### Architecture

`(app)/tutor/layout.tsx` reverted from slice 2.6's AppShell-rendering
shape back to a **slim TUTOR role gate**. Each tutor sub-folder owns
its own chrome via two new Server Component helpers:

- `<TutorGlobalShell>` — wraps the 5 global sub-folders (programmes,
  bank, students, payments, profile). Renders AppShell with
  `productLabel="· Tutor"` + the global sidebar.
- `<TutorProgrammeShell>` — wraps `programmes/[programme_id]/*`.
  Renders AppShell with `productLabel="· Tutor"` + the programme
  sidebar + a back pill in the topbar's right slot.

Both helpers call `loadChromeData()` (one PostgREST round-trip per
request) and pass the same shape into `<AppShell>`. Per-folder layout
files stay 3 lines each — the shells are the single source of chrome
composition.

### Route moves (Phase 1 — clean break, no redirects)

- `tutor/trends/page.tsx` → `tutor/bank/trends/page.tsx`
- `tutor/trends/[trend_id]/page.tsx` → `tutor/bank/trends/[trend_id]/page.tsx`
- `tutor/trends/new/page.tsx` → `tutor/bank/trends/new/page.tsx`
- `tutor/bank/page.tsx` → `tutor/bank/all/page.tsx` (and a new
  `tutor/bank/page.tsx` redirect lands users at `/tutor/bank/all`)

Reference updates:
- `BASE_URL` in moved files
- `redirect()` and `<Link href>` in tutor bank list (focus-mode
  redirect for trend children, "Trend datasets →" header card)
- "← Back to bank" link in tutor cases list page now points to
  `/tutor/bank/all`
- `lib/bank/list-view.tsx` `wrapperBaseUrl()` for trends
- `lib/bank/trend/editor.tsx` surface URL builder
- `lib/bank/trend/actions.ts` surface config (drives revalidatePath)

Case Study routes were NOT moved — already at `/tutor/bank/cases/*`
from slice 1.11a. The nav config uses the existing slug; sidebar
label is "Case Studies".

### Files created (Phases 2–6)

- `lib/nav/tutor.ts` — `TUTOR_GLOBAL_NAV` + `TUTOR_PROGRAMME_NAV`.
  Global config has `children` on the bank entry. Programme hrefs
  use `:programmeId` placeholder substituted by the layout.
- `components/nav/shared/nav-icon.tsx` — moved from
  `components/nav/student/`. Now shared across audiences. Added 7
  new icons: `users`, `card`, `layers`, `chart`, `edit`,
  `arrow-left`, `chevron-down`. Paths copied verbatim from
  `tutor-nav.html`'s mockup.
- `components/nav/tutor/global-sidebar.tsx` — collapsible-parent
  client sidebar. Default-expanded if any child href is a prefix of
  current pathname. Click parent → toggle only (sub-items navigate).
- `components/nav/tutor/programme-sidebar.tsx` — flat list, mirrors
  the student sidebar's pattern with a "This programme" header.
- `components/nav/tutor/back-pill.tsx` — server component, renders
  in the topbar `rightSlot` only inside programme context.
- `components/nav/tutor/global-shell.tsx` + `programme-shell.tsx` —
  the two reusable chrome helpers.
- `app/(app)/tutor/programmes/page.tsx` — Home (list) with two
  hardcoded demo cards.
- `app/(app)/tutor/programmes/[programme_id]/{layout,page,overview,weeks,sessions,mocks,assignments,students,results}` — programme context: 1 layout + redirect + 7 placeholders.
- `app/(app)/tutor/{programmes,bank,students,payments,profile}/layout.tsx` — 5 thin global-shell layout files.
- `app/(app)/tutor/{students,payments,profile}/page.tsx` — 3 global placeholder pages.
- `app/(app)/tutor/bank/page.tsx` — redirect to `/tutor/bank/all`.

### Files edited

- `lib/nav/types.ts` — `NavIcon` union grew by 7. `NavItem` gained
  optional `children?: NavItem[]`.
- `components/nav/student/sidebar.tsx` — nav-icon import path
  updated to `@/components/nav/shared/nav-icon`.
- `app/(app)/tutor/layout.tsx` — reverted to slim role gate.
- `app/(app)/tutor/page.tsx` — was placeholder dashboard, now
  redirects to `/tutor/programmes`.
- `app/(app)/tutor/bank/cases/page.tsx` — back link now targets
  `/tutor/bank/all`.
- `lib/bank/list-view.tsx`, `lib/bank/trend/editor.tsx`,
  `lib/bank/trend/actions.ts` — trend baseUrls updated.
- `styles/nav.css` — appended sections for collapsible sidebar
  parents, sidebar header, back pill, programmes list page,
  programme cards.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/tutor-nav.html` — added build note
  callout at the top.

### Decisions captured

- **Cases keep short slug.** `/tutor/bank/cases/` (existing) over
  the spec's `/tutor/bank/case-studies/`. URL slug is internal;
  sidebar label remains "Case Studies".
- **Tutor layout reverts to role gate.** Slice 2.6's AppShell wrap
  is unwound — programme context can't replace the sidebar without
  this revert because nested AppShells double-render.
- **Programme shell 404s on unknown programme id.** With no DB to
  consult yet, an unknown `[programme_id]` triggers `notFound()`
  rather than rendering a fake-titled chrome.
- **No placeholder badges in the sidebar.** The mockup shows
  "placeholder" pills next to Payments / Mocks / Assignments;
  skipped for v1 since every page is a placeholder anyway. Add
  back when only some pages are placeholders.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean
- `npx eslint app components lib` — clean
- `npm run build` — clean (route count grew, see route list below)
- Browser preview spot-check pending in the verification step.

### What's unblocked

- Admin nav scaffold (slice 2.8 — last of the three).

### Next session

Admin nav scaffold per `docs/product-plan/admin-nav.html`.

---

## Session — 2026-04-25 (Slice 2.6 — Student nav scaffold + folder convention — Claude Web + Desktop)

Two things landed in one slice:

1. **Folder convention** adopted repo-wide: components grouped by
   domain (`shell/`, `nav/<audience>/`), CSS promoted to top-level
   `styles/`, audiences live under `app/(app)/{student,tutor,admin}/`.
2. **Student nav scaffold** end-to-end: picker landing, bank product
   space (6 pages), programme product space (5 pages), product
   switcher with upsell modal, post-login redirect to picker.

### Architectural shift

`(app)/layout.tsx` is now a slim auth boundary — it redirects to
/login if no user, imports the workspace CSS (`tokens`, `dashboards`,
`shell`, `nav`), and renders children. **It no longer renders the
topbar or footer.** Each audience layout calls a new
`loadChromeData()` helper and wraps children in `<AppShell>`,
passing its own `productLabel` and `rightSlot` (e.g.
`<ProductSwitcher />`). This avoids middleware-pathname tricks
that the original handoff prescribed (the `x-pathname` snippet had
a real bug — sets header on response not next request).

Collateral: tutor and admin layouts were updated to render their
own `<AppShell>` so they didn't lose chrome when the parent stopped
rendering it. Tutor layout: now does its own AppShell wrap with no
productLabel/rightSlot. Admin layout: created (didn't exist) with
ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN gate + AppShell wrap. Both are minimal — full
admin and tutor nav scaffolds land in their own slices later.

### Files moved (Phase 1 tidy)

- `components/{topbar,footer,role-chip,user-menu}.tsx` →
  `components/shell/{...}.tsx`
- `app/{tokens,shell,dashboards,auth,landing}.css` →
  `styles/{...}.css`
- 8 import sites updated to the new paths.

### Files created

- **lib/**
  - `lib/nav/types.ts` — `NavItem` + `NavIcon` union (9 icons)
  - `lib/nav/student.ts` — `STUDENT_BANK_NAV` (6 items, `practice`
    key replaces `bank`) + `STUDENT_PROGRAMME_NAV` (5 items)
  - `lib/shell/load-chrome-data.ts` — fetches user/profile/roles +
    resolves `viewingAs` from cookie

- **components/**
  - `components/shell/app-shell.tsx` — chrome wrapper (shell-root +
    topbar + body + footer)
  - `components/nav/shared/placeholder.tsx` — "Coming soon" body
  - `components/nav/student/sidebar.tsx` — generic sidebar driven
    by `NavItem[]`, active-state via `usePathname` + `startsWith`
  - `components/nav/student/nav-icon.tsx` — switch-on-name returning
    inline SVG, paths copied verbatim from the mockup
  - `components/nav/student/product-switcher.tsx` — topbar pill
    toggle, opens upsell modal for bank-only students
  - `components/nav/student/upsell-modal.tsx` — modal with click-
    outside + Escape dismissal

- **app/**
  - `app/(app)/admin/layout.tsx` — new admin role gate + AppShell
  - `app/(app)/student/picker/page.tsx` — picker landing
  - `app/(app)/student/bank/layout.tsx` + `page.tsx` (redirect) +
    `dashboard/`, `practice/`, `packs/`, `journey/`, `history/`,
    `profile/page.tsx`
  - `app/(app)/student/programme/layout.tsx` + `page.tsx` (redirect)
    + `overview/`, `weeks/`, `sessions/`, `tasks/`, `profile/page.tsx`
  - `app/programmes/page.tsx` — public placeholder, sits outside
    `(app)`, styled with the existing landing tokens
  - `styles/nav.css` — sidebar, picker, switcher, modal, placeholder

### Files edited

- `app/(app)/layout.tsx` — stripped to auth + CSS imports + children
- `app/(app)/tutor/layout.tsx` — now renders its own AppShell
- `app/(app)/student/page.tsx` — was the dashboard, now redirects to
  `/student/picker`
- `app/router/page.tsx` — `STUDENT: '/student' → '/student/picker'`
- `components/shell/topbar.tsx` — added optional `productLabel` +
  `rightSlot` props
- `mynclex/CLAUDE.md` — new "Folder Conventions" section
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/student-nav.md` — URL prefix note +
  `bank → practice` route key rename

### Known placeholder data

`hasBankSubscription`, `bankDaysLeft`, `hasProgrammeEnrolment`,
`programmeTitle`, `programmeWeek`, `programmeTotalWeeks` are all
hard-coded in the picker page and audience layouts. The real
`nclex_subscriptions` and `nclex_enrolments` tables don't exist
yet — placeholders get replaced when those tables ship.

The bank layout passes `hasProgrammeEnrolment={false}` to the
ProductSwitcher today (so clicking Programme opens the upsell
modal). The programme layout passes `true` (so a programme student
can switch back to bank). Both flips happen for free when the
enrolment table lands.

### What's unblocked

- Tutor nav scaffold (Slice 2.7)
- Admin nav scaffold (Slice 2.8)

### Next session

Tutor nav scaffold per `docs/product-plan/tutor-nav.html`.
Architecture is the same as student: `(app)/tutor/{programmes,
my-bank, my-students, payments, profile}/...` plus nested
`(app)/tutor/programmes/[id]/*` with its own programme-scoped
sidebar and back pill.

## Session — 2026-04-24 (Slice 1.12 wrap + bank-list polish — Claude Web + Desktop)

Shipped the Trend wrapper (NGN 10th type) end-to-end across
three sub-slices plus a bank-list polish follow-up. MyNclex
authoring is now complete — every NGN question type family
ships in v1.

### What shipped today

- Slice 1.12a (commit 229287d) — nclex_trend_datasets schema +
  dataset editor. Kind-template picker (5 presets + Custom),
  data-table authoring (rows × timepoints, per-cell flags,
  optional ref-range column).
- Slice 1.12b (commit edd01e3) — trend_id FK on
  nclex_bank_items, attached questions on the right pane with
  variable pill count, transactional save RPC
  nclex_save_trend_with_children.
- Slice 1.12c (commits a6d883b + bcd1423) — delete flow
  (detach-and-delete / delete-everything with typed DELETE),
  validation panel (8 errors + 4 warnings), bank.md revised
  to as-built shape.
- Bank-list polish (commit 1ed5a8d) — case-children visible
  in bank list (stance reversal from 1.11b), context-aware
  Edit labels, clickable wrapper badges, Membership filter,
  composition counts (filtered/total format).

### What's unblocked

Student runner. Every authoring surface is done. The runner
can now consume standalone questions, case studies, and
trend items without waiting on any authoring work.

### Next session

Planning discussion — not building. The layer between bank
and runner needs architecture settled before any build
starts: quiz builder mechanics, quiz session storage,
runner modes (Learning / Timed / Mock / Readiness / CAT),
results and history, analytics capture strategy. Likely 2-3
planning sessions before any build handoff.

---

## Session — 2026-04-24 (Bank-list polish — wrapper visibility + context edit + membership filter)

Six changes to the shared bank list surface. Both admin and tutor
banks now show every authored question — standalone, case-linked,
trend-linked — in the same list, with wrapper-aware affordances:

1. **Case exclusion removed.** `.is('parent_case_id', null)` was
   dropped from both main + count queries on both surfaces.
   Case-children now render alongside standalones and trend-
   children. This is a **stance reversal** from 1.11b — not a
   bug fix. 1.11b *chose* to hide case-children because the edit
   path hadn't been hardened; now that protection exists (the
   `?edit=` redirect to the case editor), hiding them is
   over-strict.
2. **Trend-child Edit redirect added.** The server page's
   focus-mode load grew a parallel `if (full.trend_id)` branch
   mirroring the 1.11b case redirect. Clicking Edit on a
   trend-linked row routes to
   `/admin/trends/[trend_id]?focus=[item_id]` instead of opening
   the standalone editor. Pre-1.12c only case had this; trend
   was falling through to the standalone editor (real bug
   silently shipped).
3. **Context-aware Edit label.** The Edit button text varies:
   `Edit` / `Edit in case editor` / `Edit in trend editor`. The
   href stays uniform `?edit=ID`; only the button copy changes.
4. **Composition-counts row.** Four buckets displayed as
   `filtered/total` under the page title — Total, Standalone,
   Case-linked, Trend-linked. Replaces the old
   `{rows.length} of {total} questions` subtitle (dropped this
   slice — two stacked totals would be redundant).
5. **Membership filter.** Sixth dropdown on the filter bar,
   sitting between Status and Search. Options:
   `All / Standalone / Case-linked / Trend-linked`. Threaded
   through `BankFilterValues` + `BankSearchParams` +
   `buildFilterQueryString` identically to the existing 5
   filters.
6. **Clickable wrapper badges.** The `In case · {title}` and
   `Trend · {title}` chips are now `<Link>` elements that jump
   straight to the wrapper editor focused on that question —
   same destination as Edit, faster to click.

### Locked decisions (from handoff + two Q&A disambiguations)

Handoff-locked:
- **Show every question by default.** Hide-and-redirect is stricter
  than necessary now that both wrappers have edit-redirect coverage.
- **Protect wrapper edits.** Both case and trend children bounce to
  the wrapper editor. Redirect-check order: **trend_id first, then
  parent_case_id.** Rationale beyond "arbitrary": parent_case_id
  has `ON DELETE SET NULL`, trend_id has `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, so
  a row that was once both can legitimately end up with only
  `trend_id` set post-cascade — trend-first correctly catches it.
- **Three Edit-label variants** — `Edit` / `Edit in case editor`
  / `Edit in trend editor`.
- **Counts format** `filtered/total`. Total scoped to surface
  (admin counts don't include tutor items).
- **One new filter, four values.** Membership: All / Standalone /
  Case-linked / Trend-linked. Default All (absent URL param).
- **Clickable badges, no row colour.** Badges carry enough signal.

Disambiguated before build (my two Qs, Sam accepted both):
- **`filtered` counts exclude the membership filter.** Otherwise
  3 of 4 counts would collapse to 0 whenever a membership is
  picked (the main query applies membership; the count queries
  deliberately skip it).
- **Drop the `{rows.length} of {total} questions` subtitle.**
  Composition-row's `Total N/M` replaces it cleanly.

### Schema

No schema changes. All four relevant FK constraints already exist
with Supabase-default naming (verified against dev `pg_catalog`):

- `nclex_bank_items_parent_case_id_fkey` → `nclex_case_studies(case_id)`
- `nclex_bank_items_trend_id_fkey`       → `nclex_trend_datasets(trend_id)`
- `nclex_tutor_questions_parent_case_id_fkey` → `nclex_tutor_case_studies(case_id)`
- `nclex_tutor_questions_trend_id_fkey`       → `nclex_tutor_trend_datasets(trend_id)`

The Supabase FK-join aliases (`case:nclex_case_studies(title)` etc.)
resolve automatically — no `!constraint_name` hint needed.

### Architectural notes

- **Nine queries per list load.** One main rows query + eight
  COUNTs (4 surface-totals + 4 filtered-bucket). All 9 go through
  `Promise.all`, so wall-time is dominated by the slowest. At dev
  scale (29 rows total) this is well under 100ms. Worth
  revisiting if the bank grows past ~100k rows; `count: 'exact'`
  isn't free at that scale.
- **`countQuery` helper lives locally in each page.** Tutor
  version scopes every count to `.eq('tutor_id', user!.id)` —
  RLS handles this too, but belt-and-braces makes the scope
  visible in the source. The `user!` non-null assertion is safe
  because the `redirect('/login')` earlier in the function
  short-circuits on anon.
- **FullBankRow `trend_id` drift-fix.** Pre-slice, `FullBankRow`
  declared `parent_case_id` but not `trend_id` — the `SELECT *`
  returned `trend_id` at runtime but the type didn't know. Fixed
  by promoting both `parent_case_id` and `trend_id` onto the
  shared `BankRow` interface (they belong there now that the
  list renderer needs them). `FullBankRow` carries them via
  inheritance; its own field list got shorter.
- **Row-map fallback for missing joined titles.** If the FK join
  returns null (dataset deleted mid-query, race condition), the
  server falls back to showing the raw ID (`In case · NCLEX_CS_00001`)
  rather than hiding the badge. The curator needs to see the
  membership; a missing title is an "unknown dataset" state, not
  an "unlinked question" state.
- **Focus-mode navigator stays as-is.** The compact nav in
  `/admin/bank?edit=X` now lists every row including wrapper
  children. Clicking a wrapper-child nav link mid-edit fires the
  server redirect → bank editor unmounts → curator lands in
  the wrapper editor. Coherent but a UX surprise worth noting.
  Could be hardened later by hiding wrapper children in the nav;
  deliberately deferred.

### Files created

- None. Every change modifies existing files.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/list-view.tsx` — `BankRow` gains
  `parent_case_id`, `trend_id`, `case_title`. `BankSearchParams`
  + `BankListViewProps` gain `membership` and `counts`. New
  `BankCompositionCounts` type. New `CompositionCounts`
  component rendering the four buckets. New `wrapperBaseUrl`
  helper mapping baseUrl × kind to editor root. `BrowseRow`
  computes `editLabel` + `caseBadgeHref` + `trendBadgeHref`;
  both wrapper badges are `<Link>` elements with
  `.bank-badge-link`. `renderBrowseMode` drops the subtitle and
  mounts `<CompositionCounts>` above the filter bar.
  `buildFilterQueryString` preserves `membership`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/filters.tsx` — `BankFilterValues` gains
  `membership`. New `<select>` labelled Membership between
  Status and Search.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — case exclusion
  removed; select extends with `parent_case_id, trend_id,
  case:nclex_case_studies(title)`; membership filter applied
  to main query only; local `countQuery` helper drives 8
  COUNT queries; `trend_id` redirect branch added ahead of the
  case branch.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/page.tsx` — same changes
  against tutor tables (joins point at
  `nclex_tutor_case_studies` / `nclex_tutor_trend_datasets`;
  redirects go to `/tutor/bank/cases/...` /
  `/tutor/trends/...`; counts scope to
  `.eq('tutor_id', user.id)`).
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — appended `.bank-counts-row` +
  `.bank-count-item` + `.bank-count-label` + `.bank-count-value`
  + `.bank-badge-case` + `.bank-badge-link` block. Purple
  palette (`#eeedfe / #3c3489 / #afa9ec`) matches existing
  `.cs-pill.info` + `.tr-delete-dialog__attached-type` chips.

### Files NOT modified (explicitly)

- `mynclex/lib/bank/navigator.tsx` — focus-mode nav shape
  unchanged; see the architectural note above.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/`, `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/` —
  not touched. Pure list-surface slice.
- No schema, no RLS, no migrations.
- No editor components.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app lib` — clean.
- `npm run build` — clean. **25 routes**, unchanged.
- Pre-slice dev counts (from investigation): 29 total / 22
  standalone / 4 case-linked / 3 trend-linked. Same count
  helper on the page should produce the same numbers on page
  load.
- No browser test this session; Sam verifies.

### Known temporaries / deferrals

- **Focus-mode navigator.** Lists wrapper children alongside
  standalones now. Clicking one mid-edit triggers the server
  redirect, unmounting the bank editor. Acceptable for now;
  could be hidden in a follow-up if it trips curators.
- **Count query cost at scale.** 8 COUNTs per load is fine at
  dev scale but not free at 10k+ rows. Revisit if/when.

### Next session

- **Sam's browser-side verification** per the handoff's
  11-step script (admin list showing all three kinds, badge
  click, Edit click, membership filter, tutor twin).
- **Student runner** — still the only unbuilt piece of the
  MyNclex authoring/consumption loop.

---

## Session — 2026-04-24 (Slice 1.12c — Trend delete flow + validation + bank.md revision)

Slice 1.12c closes out Trend authoring. Three independent pieces:

1. **Delete-with-confirmation dialog** handles datasets with and
   without attached questions, with a typed `DELETE` confirmation
   and two explicit destructive paths backed by four new RPCs.
2. **Validation panel** mirrors the 1.11c Case Study pattern with 8
   errors + 4 warnings. Manual-only; never auto-runs on Save.
3. **`bank.md` Trend section revised** from "planned shape" to
   "as built". Shipped as a solo commit (`a6d883b`) before any
   code so the doc fix was insulated from later build risk.

The student runner is now unblocked on the Trend family; the only
remaining MyNclex authoring slice is done. Case Study + Trend are
both production-ready.

### Schema (applied to dev `zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- Four new RPC functions, matching the 1.12b two-per-surface
  convention:
  - `nclex_detach_and_delete_trend(p_trend_id TEXT)` — NULLs the
    `trend_id` on every attached `nclex_bank_items` row, then
    deletes the dataset. Questions survive as standalone.
  - `nclex_delete_trend_and_children(p_trend_id TEXT)` — deletes
    attached items + the dataset in one transaction.
  - Parallel tutor twins: `nclex_tutor_detach_and_delete_trend`,
    `nclex_tutor_delete_trend_and_children`. All four
    `GRANT EXECUTE TO authenticated`.
- No new tables, no new columns, no new RLS policies. All four
  RPCs operate on tables that already have RLS enabled.
- `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on the `trend_id` FK remains — the
  belt-and-braces safety net against anyone bypassing the server
  action entirely. Neither new RPC relies on it: detach first
  NULLs the FK; delete-everything removes child items before the
  parent row, which doesn't trigger RESTRICT either way.

### Locked decisions (from handoff)

- **Typed confirmation text:** `DELETE`. Case-sensitive.
- **Single Delete button in the topbar, two paths in the dialog.**
  Topbar stays clean; dialog picks Detach vs Delete-everything
  via radio-ish choice cards.
- **Validation severity:** errors + warnings (2-level, same as 1.11c).
- **Validate is manual only.** Save behaviour is untouched.
- **Bank-editor "Attach trend" dropdown deferred indefinitely.**
  Same posture Case Study took — authoring canonically lives in
  the wrapper's editor.

### Validation rules shipped

*Errors (block publish when `is_published = TRUE`):*
- `trend.title.missing`
- `trend.rows.zero`
- `trend.timepoints.zero`
- `trend.row_values_mismatch` — per-row integrity check
- `trend.question.zero_on_publish`
- `slot.stem.missing`
- `slot.type.missing`
- `slot.content.invalid` — runs `initialToParsedItem` per child;
  surfaces the parser's own error text so the curator sees
  (for example) "Option 2 text is required".

*Warnings (advisory):*
- `trend.scenario.missing`
- `trend.question.zero_on_draft`
- `trend.question.type_diversity` — 3+ children all sharing one
  host type
- `trend.flags.none` — no cells flagged anywhere

Panel header logic same as 1.11c: `Ready to publish` (green) /
`N errors, M warnings — not ready` (red) /
`Draft — N errors, M warnings` (neutral).

### Architectural notes

- **`slot.content.invalid` reuses `initialToParsedItem`.** The same
  helper the save action uses is imported directly into the
  client-side validator. Confirmed client-safe (no `'use server'`,
  no server-only imports in `initial-to-parsed.ts` or any parser).
  Saves reimplementing the parametric-object construction and
  guarantees the validator + save RPC caller agree on what counts
  as valid content.
- **Defense-in-depth on bare delete.** `deleteTrendAction` now
  checks for attached children before calling DELETE. If ≥1
  found → refuses with a friendly message pointing at the dialog
  flow. `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on the FK is the last line of
  defence if someone sidesteps the server action.
- **Unsaved child drafts excluded from the delete dialog's
  attached-items list.** Drafts where `item_id === null` haven't
  been persisted, so they don't count as "dataset has attached
  questions". Filter happens in the editor before passing
  `attachedItems` into `DeleteDialog`.
- **Validate button toggles via `.tr-btn.is-open` class.** Clicking
  while open closes the panel (matches 1.11c).
- **Backdrop click closes the dialog, but only when not pending.**
  Avoids accidentally dismissing an in-flight destructive call.

### Files created

- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_trend_delete_rpcs_slice_1_12c.sql`
  — four RPC function definitions + GRANT EXECUTE. ~180 lines.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/validation.ts` — types
  (`TrendEditorState`, `TrendEditorChildSnapshot`,
  `ValidationIssue`, `Severity`, `PanelSummary`),
  `TREND_VALIDATION_RULES` flat rule array, `validateTrend()` +
  `summarise()` helpers.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/validation-panel.tsx` — pure-
  presentation floating panel mirroring
  `cs-validate-panel` visual conventions.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/delete-dialog.tsx` — modal with
  zero-vs-≥1 attached branching, radio-ish choice cards,
  typed-`DELETE` confirm.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — solo-committed in
  `a6d883b`. Replaced the old "planned shape" Trend section with
  an "as built" description: no classification on the dataset,
  `kind` is freeform TEXT with UI template sugar, delete
  semantics via the two RPC-backed paths. Removed the
  `Why v2, not v1` footnote.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/actions.ts`:
  - Tightened `deleteTrendAction` — pre-check for attached
    children; refuse with a pointer to the dialog flow if any.
  - Added `detachAndDeleteTrendAction` and
    `deleteTrendAndChildrenAction`, each selecting the admin
    vs tutor RPC based on surface and handling the RPC's
    error / unexpected-shape responses.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/editor.tsx`:
  - Topbar Delete button now opens the modal (was calling
    `deleteTrendAction` directly via a form).
  - New Validate topbar button between Cancel and Save; toggles
    the floating validation panel.
  - `buildValidatorState()` assembles the snapshot from the
    uncontrolled dataset form DOM + the active child's DOM
    snapshot + current child drafts. Mirrors 1.11c's
    `buildValidatorState` pattern.
  - Three new delete handlers (`onDeleteEmpty`,
    `onDetachAndDelete`, `onDeleteEverything`) routed via a
    shared `runDeleteAction` helper so the pending/error state
    stays consistent across paths.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/types.ts` — re-exports the validator's
  public types (`TrendEditorState`, `ValidationIssue`, etc.) so
  the editor can barrel-import from `./types`.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — appended `.tr-validate-panel*`,
  `.tr-btn.is-open`, and `.tr-delete-dialog*` blocks (~300 lines).

### Files NOT modified (explicitly)

- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — RPC definitions stay in the migration
  file only; schema.sql remains a tables-and-indexes reference.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — no policy changes.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/`, `parsers/`,
  `question-authoring-panel.tsx` — unchanged.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/**` — pattern source, not modified.
- The standalone bank-editor pages (`/admin/bank/new`,
  `/admin/bank/[item_id]`) — no "Attach trend" dropdown per
  handoff decision 6.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app lib` — clean.
- `npm run build` — clean. **25 routes**, unchanged from 1.12b
  (this slice wires into existing routes).
- Dev Supabase: `SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE
  '%trend%'` returns 6 functions (2 save + 4 delete).
- No browser test this session. Sam verifies per the handoff
  script.

### Known temporaries / deferrals

- **Bank-editor "Attach trend" dropdown** — deferred indefinitely.
  Curator authoring stays in the trend editor.
- **Drag-to-reorder** — still not in v1 for rows, timepoints, or
  attached questions.
- **Student runner** — separate track; now unblocked by 1.12b/c.
- **Admin filter by `kind`** — wait until `kind` values stabilise
  in practice.

### Next session

- **Student runner** — the Case Study + Trend families are now
  fully authorable end-to-end. Runner can consume real datasets,
  attached questions, and the flags / ref-range metadata the
  authoring editor writes.
- **Browser verification (Sam)** — the 7-step script in the
  1.12c handoff (`When done` section). Key flows: validate clean,
  validate with issues, delete empty dataset, delete with
  detach, delete everything, direct-API bypass attempt.

## Session — 2026-04-24 (Slice 1.12b — Trend attached questions + save RPC)

Slice 1.12b fills the right half of the Trend editor — datasets
now attach variable-N bank questions via the new nullable FK
`trend_id` on `nclex_bank_items` (plus the tutor twin). The editor
mounts a pill strip + `QuestionAuthoringPanel` in `standalone`
mode per active pill; Save serialises dataset header + live child
drafts + pending deletions into a single JSONB payload that the
new `nclex_save_trend_with_children` RPC writes atomically.

### Schema (applied to dev)

- **New FK column**: `trend_id TEXT NULL REFERENCES
  nclex_trend_datasets(trend_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT` on
  `nclex_bank_items`; parallel FK to `nclex_tutor_trend_datasets`
  on `nclex_tutor_questions`.
- **Partial indexes**: `nclex_bank_items_trend_id_idx` +
  `nclex_tutor_questions_trend_id_idx`, both `WHERE trend_id IS
  NOT NULL`. 99% of bank items stay NULL so the partial index
  keeps cost off non-trend rows.
- **RPC**: `nclex_save_trend_with_children(payload jsonb)` +
  `nclex_tutor_save_trend_with_children(payload jsonb)`. Two
  parallel entry points, one per surface, as specified in the
  handoff (case-study's RPC took surface as an arg and branched
  internally; Trend follows the handoff's explicit two-function
  shape). `GRANT EXECUTE … TO authenticated` on both.
- **RLS**: no new policies. Existing `nclex_bank_items` and
  `nclex_tutor_questions` policies cover trend-linked rows
  identically to standalone rows. Audit comment added to
  `rls.sql` so the trail is complete.

### Locked state-matrix rules (from handoff + plan doc)

- **Dataset `is_published` is independent of per-question
  `is_published`.** RPC enforces no consistency between them.
- **Type picker optional at draft, required at publish.** Empty
  slots (no `question_type` AND empty stem) are dropped by both
  the client filter and the RPC's skip-filter. A published
  dataset validates that every surviving question has a type +
  non-empty stem; otherwise the whole save rolls back.
- **`is_builder_visible` stays TRUE by default** on trend-linked
  questions — unlike case-study children which forced it to
  FALSE. Trend questions ARE pickable from the student custom
  builder.
- **Empty-slot semantics**: consistent at client (editor filter),
  server action (same filter pre-RPC), and RPC (skip-continue).

### Files created

- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_trend_id_column_slice_1_12b.sql`
  — two ALTER TABLEs + two partial indexes.
- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_trend_save_rpc_slice_1_12b.sql`
  — the two RPC functions + GRANT EXECUTE. ~380 lines total.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/child-draft.ts` — `TrendChildDraft`
  shape (`item_id`, `initial`, `isDirty`, `toDelete`),
  `emptyChildDraft()`, `loadChildDraft(row)`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/question-nav.tsx` — pill strip with
  `+ Add question` trailing button, horizontal scroll on
  overflow. Variable count; no CJMM step; pending-delete pill
  rendered with strikethrough.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/types.ts` — `TrendEditorInitial`
  extended with `attachedItems: FullBankRow[]`. Re-exports
  `TrendChildDraft`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/editor.tsx` — rewrote right pane.
  Added child-draft state + active-index state +
  `slotFormRef` (mirrors case-study 1.11b snapshot pattern).
  New handlers: `onSelectPill`, `onAddQuestion`,
  `onDeleteActive`. `onSave` snapshots the active draft's DOM
  + serialises non-deleted drafts → `questions_json` + persisted
  toDelete ids → `deleted_item_ids`. `onDelete` pre-checks for
  attached children and refuses bare delete with a friendly
  error (1.12c will replace with the guided detach flow).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/actions.ts` — `updateTrendAction`
  rewritten to parse `questions_json` + `deleted_item_ids`,
  validate each child via `initialToParsedItem` (reused from
  admin/bank), build the RPC payload, and call
  `nclex_{,tutor_}save_trend_with_children`. Empty-slot filter
  (no stem) applied as defence-in-depth.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/trends/[trend_id]/page.tsx` +
  tutor twin — now fetch attached items in parallel with the
  dataset (`ORDER BY created_at ASC`); pass them via
  `initial.attachedItems`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/list-view.tsx` — `BankRow` gains
  `trend_title: string | null`. `BrowseRow` renders a
  `bank-badge bank-badge-trend` chip showing `Trend · {title}`
  on linked rows.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` + tutor twin —
  select-query extended with the FK-join
  `trend:nclex_trend_datasets(title)` (admin) /
  `trend:nclex_tutor_trend_datasets(title)` (tutor); flat
  `trend_title` computed in the mapping before passing to
  `BankListView`.
- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — appended ALTER TABLE + indexes in
  a dated 2026-04-24 section. Function bodies are NOT mirrored
  into schema.sql; the migration file is the authoritative
  source for PL/pgSQL definitions.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — dated comment block noting no new
  policies needed.
- `mynclex/db/seed-trends-dev.sql` — appended `NCLEX_MCQ_91001`
  + `NCLEX_MAT_91001` attached to the demo dataset
  `NCLEX_TRD_00001`.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — appended `.tr-q-nav-*` +
  `.tr-q-pane-*` + `.bank-badge-trend` block (~150 lines).

### Files NOT modified (explicitly)

- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/` + `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/` —
  the 9 per-type editors and their parsers reused verbatim.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/question-authoring-panel.tsx` — stays as-is;
  Trend uses existing `standalone` mode.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/**` — reference pattern only.
- The standalone bank editor pages (`/admin/bank` focus mode,
  `/admin/bank/new`) — "Attach trend" dropdown is deferred to
  1.12c per the handoff.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — trend section still
  reflects the pre-revision shape. 1.12c will revise.

### Architectural notes worth remembering

- **Reused `initialToParsedItem` across three slices now.**
  Standalone bank (parser in actions.ts), case-child save
  (1.11b), trend-child save (1.12b). The helper's three-way
  drift-trap comment at the top of the file still holds — any
  per-type shape change needs checking against all three paths.
- **Cross-boundary import.** `lib/bank/trend/actions.ts` imports
  `initialToParsedItem` from `app/(app)/admin/bank/initial-to-parsed.ts`
  — the same backwards-dependency case-study/actions.ts
  established in 1.11b. Accepted; a future lift to a neutral
  `lib/bank/` module would clean this up across both wrappers at
  once.
- **FK-join on Supabase** for the bank-list badge uses the alias
  syntax `trend:nclex_trend_datasets(title)`. Shape at runtime:
  `{trend: {title} | null}`. Row mapping extracts to flat
  `trend_title` before passing into the shared `BankListView`.

### Divergences / drift points encountered

1. **Handoff mentions `lib/bank/case-study/question-nav.tsx` as
   the component to mirror.** That file doesn't exist — case-study's
   `QuestionNavigator` is an inline function at
   `lib/bank/case-study/editor.tsx:1072`. Mirrored that shape
   into `lib/bank/trend/question-nav.tsx` (new standalone file).
2. **`QuestionAuthoringPanel` key management.** Case-study uses
   `key={activeSlot}` to force remount when switching slots;
   Trend does the same with `key={activeIndex ?? -1}` for
   identical reasons — defaultValue-driven inputs inside the
   panel pick up the active draft's fields on mount only.
3. **Type-change inside an existing question.** Per the 1.11b
   pattern, the panel disables the type select in edit mode so
   content/correct shape can't drift. Trend inherits this — same
   edit-mode gate. If the curator wants to change type, they
   delete the question and add a new one.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app lib` — clean (one warning fixed mid-slice:
  unused `prev` in a `setActiveIndex` callback).
- `npm run build` — clean. **25 routes**, same as 1.12a.
  1.12b wires functionality into existing routes; no new ones.
- Dev Supabase state: 2 columns + 2 indexes + 2 functions
  added; seed dataset `NCLEX_TRD_00001` now has 2 attached
  items (`NCLEX_MCQ_91001`, `NCLEX_MAT_91001`).
- No browser test this session; Sam runs the dev worker.

### Next session

- **Slice 1.12c** — three pieces: (a) delete-with-attached-
  questions confirmation dialog + two RPCs (detach-and-delete,
  delete-everything), (b) validation panel mirroring 1.11c,
  (c) bank-editor "Attach trend" dropdown (secondary authoring
  path) + inline "Create new" link.
- **Browser verification** — Sam's verification focus per the
  handoff: add questions of varying types, switch pills to
  confirm state preservation, delete a question, save, reload,
  check persistence. Publish a dataset with a draft question
  attached — should succeed (dataset-independent). Publish with
  an attached question that has no stem — RPC should raise.
- **`docs/product-plan/bank.md` sweep** — still reflects the
  pre-revision trend shape. Revise during 1.12c after the
  build has validated the schema.

---

## Session — 2026-04-24 (Slice 1.12a — Trend dataset schema + editor)

Slice 1.12a lands the dataset layer of the Trend wrapper. A curator
can create a named trend dataset end-to-end from both `/admin/trends`
and `/tutor/trends`: pick a kind (5 presets + Custom), fill in title +
scenario, build the data table (rows × timepoints with per-cell flags
and an optional ref-range column), save, and see it listed. No
attached questions yet — the right half of the split is a "Questions
— Slice 1.12b" placeholder, mirroring how 1.11a reserved the right
half of the case editor.

### Schema

Two new tables on dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`):

- `nclex_trend_datasets` — admin-owned. Columns: `trend_id` TEXT PK,
  `title`, `scenario`, `kind`, `timepoints` JSONB, `rows` JSONB,
  `is_published`, timestamps.
- `nclex_tutor_trend_datasets` — tutor-private twin. Same shape plus
  `tutor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES nclex_users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
  and an index on `tutor_id`.

RLS enabled on both. Four policies total:

- Admin: `*_read_published` (any authenticated, is_published=TRUE) +
  `*_curate_all` (BANK_CURATE via `nclex_user_has_permission`,
  SUPER_ADMIN via the helper's short-circuit).
- Tutor: `*_tutor_own` (tutor_id = auth.uid()) +
  `*_superadmin` (SUPER_ADMIN bypass).

No `trend_id` FK on `nclex_bank_items` or `nclex_tutor_questions` —
that lands in 1.12b. Keeping the schema minimal until attachment
becomes a real feature.

### Divergences from handoff (flagged)

1. **No `set_updated_at()` trigger function.** Handoff asserted the
   helper already existed and said to just attach `CREATE TRIGGER …
   EXECUTE FUNCTION set_updated_at()` on both new tables. It does
   NOT exist — grep across `mynclex/db/**` turns up zero CREATE
   TRIGGER and zero CREATE FUNCTION for updated_at. The repo's
   convention is explicit `updated_at = NOW()` in every write path
   (see `upsertTabAction` in case-study/actions.ts and the
   `nclex_save_case_with_children` RPC). Following that convention:
   no triggers this slice; `updateTrendAction` sets `updated_at`
   explicitly. Migration header documents this. If a project-wide
   trigger pattern arrives later, it can attach to these tables
   without breaking anything.

2. **`tutor_id` FK target.** Handoff SQL named `auth.users(id)`;
   every existing tutor-scoped table in mynclex references
   `nclex_users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` instead. Followed the repo
   convention. Same practical semantics (nclex_users cascades from
   auth.users), uniform schema reads.

### Files created

- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_trend_datasets_slice_1_12a.sql`
  — the two CREATE TABLEs + RLS. Applied to dev.
- `mynclex/db/seed-trends-dev.sql` — one demo dataset
  (`NCLEX_TRD_00001`, post-op vitals, matches the mockup's Example 1).
  Three timepoints, five rows, flags + ref-range populated on every
  row so every authoring affordance renders during dev testing.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/types.ts` — `Surface`, `TrendFlag`,
  `TrendRow`, `TrendDatasetRow`, `TrendEditorInitial`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/kind-templates.ts` — `KIND_PRESETS`
  (`'vitals' | 'labs' | 'io' | 'neuro' | 'assessment'`),
  `kindDefaultLabel`, `kindEnablesRefRange`, `kindSeedData` with
  realistic row templates per preset.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/actions.ts` — `createTrendAction`,
  `updateTrendAction`, `deleteTrendAction`, `surfaceConfig` /
  `readSurface` / `requireTrendCurator` / `nextTrendId`. Mirrors
  the Case Study pattern; `parseRows()` validates alignment between
  `values[]` / `flags[]` and the dataset's timepoint count.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/editor.tsx` — top-level editor (split-pane,
  topbar, save/delete/cancel, divider with localStorage persist,
  `?saved=1` redirect).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/metadata-accordions.tsx` — two `<details>`
  accordions (Trend setup / Trend publishing). Kind picker has 5
  presets + "Custom…" with a reveal-on-select text input; a single
  hidden `name="kind"` reflects current state.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/trend/data-table.tsx` — controlled data-table
  with add/remove row, add/remove timepoint, in-place rename of
  metric labels + timepoint headers, per-cell text input, per-cell
  flag cycle button (null → abnormal → borderline → null), ref-range
  column toggle + per-row ref-range input.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/trends/page.tsx` — list view.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/trends/new/page.tsx` — minimal create form
  (kind + title); redirects to editor on success.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/trends/[trend_id]/page.tsx` — server
  component that gates + fetches + mounts `<TrendEditor surface=
  'admin'>`.
- Three tutor twin pages under `app/(app)/tutor/trends/`.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — added `TREND_ID_PREFIX =
  'NCLEX_TRD_'` and `TUTOR_TREND_ID_PREFIX = 'NCLEX_TUT_TRD_'`
  alongside the existing case prefixes.
- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — appended a dated "Added 2026-04-24 in
  Slice 1.12a" section with both CREATE TABLEs.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — appended parallel dated section with RLS
  enables + policies.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — appended a new `.tr-*` block
  (~410 lines) mirroring the `.cs-*` block's conventions.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` +
  `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/page.tsx` — added a "Trend datasets →"
  card alongside the existing "Case Studies →" card.

### Files NOT modified (explicitly)

- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/`, `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/`,
  `mynclex/lib/bank/question-authoring-panel.tsx` — no attached
  questions in 1.12a.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/**` — reference pattern to mirror, not
  to modify.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — still reflects the pre-
  revision "classification on dataset" shape. Deferred to 1.12c
  per handoff.
- `mynclex/app/landing.css`, `mynclex/db/seed_data.sql`.

### CSS hazard avoided

Initial `.tr-*` block had a comment line containing
`--danger-*/--warn-*` which the postcss parser tokenised as `*/`
prematurely closing the `/* … */` block and flooding stray
apostrophes into CSS syntax. Fixed by rewording the comment to
avoid `*/` inside comment bodies. Build failed once, then cleared.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app lib` — clean.
- `npm run build` — clean. **25 routes** (19 → 25, +6 as expected:
  `/admin/trends`, `/admin/trends/new`, `/admin/trends/[trend_id]`
  + 3 tutor twins).
- Dev Supabase state verified post-migration: 2 tables created, RLS
  enabled on both, 4 policies live, seed `NCLEX_TRD_00001` present.
- No browser test this session; Sam runs the dev worker.

### Known temporaries / deferrals

- **No `trend_id` FK on bank items** — lands in 1.12b.
- **No attached questions** — right-pane placeholder only.
- **No delete-with-attached-questions confirmation** — lands in 1.12c.
- **No transactional save RPC** — single-table update in 1.12a;
  multi-row atomic save ships with 1.12b's attached-question flow.
- **No validation panel** — lands in 1.12c.
- **Bank editor "Attach trend" dropdown** — lands in 1.12b.
- **Trend flags are author-side only** — rendered in the authoring
  UI, not intended for student runner rendering. Runner will
  suppress them (separate track).

### Next session

- **Slice 1.12b** — attached questions. Add `trend_id` FK column
  on `nclex_bank_items` + `nclex_tutor_questions`. Wire the right
  pane to a `QuestionAuthoringPanel` with a new `trend-child` mode.
  Variable pill count (unlike Case Study's fixed 6) + overflow
  scroll. Transactional save RPC `nclex_save_trend_with_children`.
  Bank editor "Attach trend" dropdown (secondary path).
- **Browser verification** — Sam to exercise dataset create / list /
  edit / delete against `NCLEX_TRD_00001` before 1.12b planning.

## Session — 2026-04-24 (Slice 1.12 planning — Claude Web)

Planning session for Slice 1.12 (Trend wrapper). All decisions
settled and captured in `mynclex/docs/product-plan/slice-1.12-plan.md`.

Headline shape:
- Own route `/admin/trends` + tutor twin. New table
  `nclex_trend_datasets` + nullable FK `trend_id` on
  `nclex_bank_items`. Parallel tutor tables.
- Classification lives on the question, NOT the dataset —
  avoids the Case Study wrapper-vs-child duplication.
- `kind` is freeform TEXT, doubles as template picker (5
  presets + Custom). Template is pure UI, only `kind`
  persists.
- Questions authored inside the trend editor (primary path),
  reusing all existing per-type editors and
  `QuestionAuthoringPanel`. Bank editor "Attach trend"
  dropdown is secondary path.
- Two-pane editor layout: dataset left, active question right,
  variable pill strip along the top of the right pane.
- Delete semantics: `ON DELETE RESTRICT` FK + two explicit UI
  paths (Detach-and-delete / Delete-everything) with
  typed-confirm.
- Three sub-slices: 1.12a schema + dataset editor, 1.12b
  attached questions, 1.12c delete + polish.

### Next session
- Slice 1.12a build handoff.

## Session — 2026-04-24 (Slice 1.11c — Preview-as-position + validation panel)

Slice 1.11c lands the last piece of the Case Study authoring
trilogy. A curator working in the case editor can now (a) preview
the chart as a student would see it at any of the six question
positions via a segmented `[Off][1][2][3][4][5][6]` control in the
chart header, and (b) run a client-side validation check via a new
topbar `Validate` button that opens a dismissible panel listing
errors and warnings with a summary header.

Zero schema changes. Zero server-action changes. The server-side
RPC from 1.11b remains the enforcement layer — the panel is early
feedback for the curator, not a replacement.

### Locked decisions (settled 2026-04-24 via Claude Web)

1. **Filtered-out entries render greyed-out with a label** —
   `"hidden until Q{visible_from}"` — rather than disappearing.
   The curator still needs to see what they authored during
   preview.
2. **Two severities — Errors and Warnings.** Errors block publish;
   warnings are advisory. Each rule carries a `'error' | 'warning'`
   tag and renders in the same panel with distinct styling.
3. **Manual Validate only.** Never auto-runs on Save. Save behaves
   exactly as before.
4. **Preview state is per-session.** React state only. No URL, no
   localStorage. Reloading resets to Off.
5. **Preview affects the chart only.** Tab rail, right-hand slot
   pane, metadata accordions, and topbar are unaffected.

### Validation rules shipped

*Errors (block publish when `is_published = TRUE`):*

- `case.title.missing` — case title empty.
- `case.summary.missing` — scenario summary empty.
- `case.tabs.zero` — zero tabs on the case.
- `case.slots.underfilled_on_publish` — publishing but fewer than
  6 slots populated (`isSlotPopulated` = stem-based, mirrors the
  server's definition).
- `slot.stem.missing` — populated slot (by intent: stem OR cjmm
  set) has empty stem.
- `slot.type.missing` — populated slot has no `question_type`.
- `slot.cjmm.missing` — populated slot has no CJMM step.

*Warnings (advisory):*

- `tab.no_entries` — tab has zero entries.
- `tab.no_q1_entry` — tab has entries but none with
  `visible_from = 1` (empty tab at Q1).
- `case.slots.underfilled_on_draft` — draft with fewer than 6
  populated slots; suppressed when `is_published = TRUE`
  (promoted to the matching error).

*Panel header logic:*

- `is_published = TRUE` + 0 errors → `Ready to publish` (green).
- `is_published = TRUE` + >0 errors → `N errors, M warnings — not
  ready` (red).
- `is_published = FALSE` → `Draft — N errors, M warnings`
  (neutral).

### Architectural notes

- **Two definitions of "populated" in the validator.** Tight =
  `isSlotPopulated(draft)` (stem-based, matches server). Loose =
  `slotHasIntent(draft, cjmm)` (stem OR cjmm set). The publish-
  count gate uses the tight definition so the client warning
  matches what the server actually rejects. The slot-level error
  rules use the loose definition so `slot.stem.missing` fires
  meaningfully — "curator clicked Q3, picked CJMM, forgot stem"
  is exactly the kind of authoring slip this panel should catch.
  Both helpers documented in `validation.ts` header.
- **Case header fields are DOM-read at Validate time.** The case
  header form is uncontrolled (defaultValue-driven), so title /
  summary / is_published live in the DOM until Save. The Validate
  click reads them via `new FormData(document.getElementById
  ('cs-case-form'))` so unsaved edits show up in validation
  immediately.
- **Active slot snapshot same pattern as onSaveCase.** Validate
  snapshots the active slot's in-flight edits via
  `parseSlotFormData` + `slotFormRef` before running. Without
  this, the curator who types a stem, clicks Validate (never
  clicked another slot first) would see stale
  `slotDrafts[activeSlot]` and a misleading
  `slot.stem.missing`. Anti-drift rule: any future client-side
  read of slot state across state hooks must reuse this
  snapshot pattern.
- **Panel is anchored to `.cs-editor-frame`.** `position: absolute`
  under the topbar, `top: 56px; right: 16px`. Max-width 440px.
  Frame gets `position: relative` so this anchors correctly.
- **`cs-chart-section` is NOT `position: relative`** (earlier
  draft had it; reverted — the panel overlays the whole editor,
  not the chart). No regressions expected since nothing else
  anchored to `cs-chart-section`.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/validation.ts` — all types (`Severity`,
  `ValidationIssue`, `CaseEditorState` + sub-shapes), the `RULES`
  array, `validateCase()` runner, `summarise()` panel-header helper.
  Pure module — no React, no DOM, no fetch. Grep-friendly flat rule
  array.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/editor.tsx` — adds `previewPosition`
  state + segmented control in chart header + banner above chart
  when preview active. Adds `validationIssues` state +
  `buildValidatorState()` DOM-snapshot helper + `onValidateClick`
  toggler + `ValidationPanel` component at file bottom + topbar
  Validate button between Cancel and Save. Disabled stub button
  from 1.11a fully removed.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/narrative-tab.tsx` — accepts
  `previewPosition: number | null`; entry cards gain
  `cs-entry--hidden` class + inline "hidden until Qx" label when
  `visible_from > previewPosition`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/structured-tab.tsx` — same treatment
  for table rows.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — appends a Slice 1.11c block:
  `.cs-preview-toggle` + `.is-active` variant, `.cs-preview-bar`,
  `.cs-entry--hidden` + `.cs-entry-hidden-label`, and the
  `.cs-validate-panel*` family (summary variants is-ready /
  is-blocked / is-draft, issue variants is-error / is-warning,
  close button, list layout). Frame receives `position: relative`
  for the panel anchor.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/slice-1.11-plan.md` — the 1.11c
  section was replaced with the locked-decisions version in the
  plan-doc commit that preceded the code commit.

### Files NOT modified (explicitly)

- `mynclex/db/**` — zero schema changes. No migration, no
  `schema.sql`, no `rls.sql`, no seed file touched.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/actions.ts` — server-action
  surface unchanged. The RPC already enforces publish-gating.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/` — per-type editors untouched.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/question-authoring-panel.tsx` — unchanged.
  The validator reads slot state from the case editor's state,
  not from the panel.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/slot-parser.ts` —
  `parseSlotFormData` and `isSlotPopulated` reused; no changes.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app lib` — clean.
- `npm run build` — clean. 19 routes (same as 1.11b).
- No browser test this session; Sam runs the dev worker to verify.

### Known deferrals / non-goals (unchanged from plan)

- Server-side validation changes. RPC from 1.11b remains the
  enforcement layer.
- Auto-running validation on Save. Save never calls `validateCase`.
- The "Clear slot" button (1.11b loose end) — still out of scope.
- The case-wrapper accordion rename (1.11b loose end) — still
  out of scope.
- Plan-doc decision 9 reversal reconciliation elsewhere in the
  plan doc — the 1.11c section is updated; sweep across other
  sections still deferred.

### Next session

- **Student runner** — fully unblocked now that Case Study
  authoring is production-ready. Case runner can consume real
  case shells + tabs + slot rows + per-slot CJMM.
- **Slice 1.12 Trend wrapper** — the next authoring slice;
  reuses the wrapper pattern 1.11a-c established.
- **`?focus=` slot auto-open** — small polish; admin/tutor bank
  list redirects case-linked edits to
  `/admin/bank/cases/[case_id]?focus=[item_id]` but the editor
  doesn't honour it on mount.
- **Plan-doc sweep** — reconcile `slice-1.11-plan.md` decision 9
  reversal across any other sections that still say
  `is_builder_visible = FALSE` on case-linked items.

---

## Session — 2026-04-24 (Slice 1.11b — Case Study child-question authoring)

Slice 1.11b lands the right-half of the Case Study editor. A curator
can now open a case at `/admin/bank/cases/[case_id]` (or the tutor
twin), pick a Q1-Q6 pill to open a slot, assign its CJMM step, and
author the full question via the shared `QuestionAuthoringPanel`.
Save case runs as a single transaction via a new Postgres function —
case header + six slot rows + six join rows land together or none
do. Clicking "Save case" rolls up all six slot drafts, snapshots the
active slot's in-flight FormData, and submits one payload.

**Plan-doc decision 9 reversed.** `mynclex/docs/product-plan/slice-1.11-plan.md`
still says case-linked items should carry `is_builder_visible = FALSE`.
This slice inverts that — case-linked children are now
`is_builder_visible = TRUE` and the standalone vs case-package split
is drawn via `parent_case_id IS NULL` instead. Rationale: the old
flag was conflating "is this content valid" with "can the student
select it stand-alone" — two different questions. Future readers of
the plan doc should trust this SESSIONS entry + the 1.11b handoff,
not the plan doc line. Plan-doc cleanup deferred to next plan-doc
pass.

### Architectural decisions (confirmed before execution)

1. **Prefix prop on per-type editors.** All nine editors in
   `lib/bank/editors/` accept `fieldPrefix?: string = ''` and
   produce prefixed `name=` attributes via a single canonical
   helper — `mynclex/lib/bank/field-prefix.ts`'s `makePrefixer()`.
   No prefix logic duplicated into individual editors. Standalone
   callers pass `''` → identity function, zero behaviour change.
2. **Typed drafts via parseSlotFormData.** New file at
   `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/slot-parser.ts` (adjacent to
   `parseFormData` in `actions.ts` as an anti-drift measure).
   Reads prefixed FormData → returns a `BankFormInitial`. Used by
   the case editor to snapshot the active slot on slot-switch and
   on save so in-flight edits survive unmount / remount.
3. **Transactional save via single Postgres RPC.** First
   multi-row atomic pattern in the repo — flagged as a new
   pattern in the migration's header comment.
4. **Case wrapper accordions untouched.** Left-half labels still
   read "Content / Classification / Housekeeping" — same labels
   as the new right-half panel's accordions. Accepted temporary;
   rename pass is a later slice.
5. **Per-type editors' stem DOM-ID kept.** Only one slot panel
   mounts at a time, so `document.getElementById('bank-stem')` in
   Cloze / Highlight / Drag-drop doesn't collide. If a future
   slice needs multiple panels on-screen simultaneously, the rule
   stays: stop and flag rather than silently rewrite stem access.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/field-prefix.ts` — `makePrefixer()`, the one
  prefix helper shared by panel + all nine editors.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/question-authoring-panel.tsx` — (already in
  Phase 2, now accepts mode + fieldPrefix as live props).
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/slot-parser.ts` — `parseSlotFormData`.
  Marked as the inverse of `parseFormData`; drift-trap comment at
  top of the file.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/initial-to-parsed.ts` —
  `initialToParsedItem`, converts a `BankFormInitial` draft to the
  JSONB shape the RPC expects. Shares `parseByType` with
  `parseFormData`, so validation stays consistent between
  standalone bank saves and case-linked saves.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/slot-loader.ts` — server-side loader
  that reads the six join rows + the linked bank items for a case
  and builds a `CaseStudySlotRow[]` via `rowToInitial`.
- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_parent_case_id_slice_1_11b.sql`
  — Phase 1; adds `parent_case_id` + partial index to
  `nclex_bank_items` and `nclex_tutor_questions`.
- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_case_save_rpc_slice_1_11b.sql`
  — Phase 4; creates `nclex_save_case_with_children(surface, case_id,
  case_patch, slots)` RPC. ~360 lines; branches admin / tutor
  internally; generates item_ids for new slots; upserts case header
  + question rows + join rows atomically; validates publish gate.
- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_case_study_items_rls_slice_1_11b.sql`
  — Phase 5; enables RLS on both join tables and adds the four
  policies (admin read-published + BANK_CURATE curate; tutor
  owner-own + SUPER_ADMIN bypass).

### Files modified

- All nine per-type editors in `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/` — added
  `fieldPrefix?: string = ''` prop, use `makePrefixer` helper.
  Sub-components (WingPanel, HiddenSerialisers, BlankCard) pass
  prefix through and create their own prefixer local.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/question-authoring-panel.tsx` — uses
  `makePrefixer` (dropped inline fn declaration); passes
  `fieldPrefix` to every per-type editor it mounts.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — added `CJMM_STEPS` + the
  `CjmmStep` string-literal union. Kept in sync with the CHECK
  constraint on `nclex_case_study_items.cjmm_step`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/types.ts` — added
  `CaseStudySlotRow`; extended `CaseStudyEditorInitial` with a
  `slots: CaseStudySlotRow[]` field (always length 6, indexed by
  position 1-6).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/editor.tsx` — replaced the 1.11a
  placeholder right-half with a live `QuestionNavigator` +
  CJMM-step `<select>` + `<QuestionAuthoringPanel mode="case-child"
  fieldPrefix="q{N}_">`. Added `slotDrafts` / `slotCjmm` /
  `activeSlot` state + `slotFormRef` for snapshot capture. Save
  handler snapshots the active slot + serialises the 6-element
  payload as `slots_json` before calling `updateCaseAction`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/actions.ts` — `updateCaseAction`
  now builds a `case_patch` JSONB + validates + parses each slot
  via `initialToParsedItem`, then invokes the RPC. Early-rejects
  a publish attempt if any slot is empty.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/list-view.tsx` — `FullBankRow` gains
  `parent_case_id: string | null`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/cases/[case_id]/page.tsx`
  + `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/cases/[case_id]/page.tsx` —
  fetch slots via `loadCaseSlots` and pass through to the editor.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx`
  + `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/page.tsx` — bank browse list
  excludes case-linked items via `.is('parent_case_id', null)`.
  Edit-mode load detects `parent_case_id` on the row and redirects
  to `/admin/bank/cases/[case_id]?focus=[item_id]` (or tutor twin).
  Satisfies the 1.11b non-negotiable that a case-linked item
  cannot open in the standalone editor.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — Phase 2 only
  (unchanged in Phase 3+); keeps the page-level form + topbar +
  server-action wiring and delegates the body to
  `QuestionAuthoringPanel`.
- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — `parent_case_id` column + partial
  index back-ported to both `CREATE TABLE` blocks.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — case-study-items policies back-ported.
- `mynclex/db/seed-cases-dev.sql` — appended three child questions
  on `NCLEX_CS_00001` at positions 1 / 2 / 3 (MCQ, MCQ, SATA) +
  the matching join rows. Positions 4-6 left empty so the
  empty-slot "+" pills are visible in the editor.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — updated `.cs-q-*` block for the
  interactive pill strip (active highlight, filled vs empty
  states, hover) and added `.cs-q-meta` (CJMM dropdown) +
  `.cs-q-empty` (no-slot-open panel). Dropped the old
  placeholder-specific styles.

### Files NOT modified (explicitly)

- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/` — per-type parser files untouched.
  `parseByType` stays the canonical validator for both
  `parseFormData` (standalone bank) and `initialToParsedItem`
  (case-child).
- Case wrapper's three accordions on the left half — left as-is;
  rename is deferred.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/tab-rail.tsx`,
  `narrative-tab.tsx`, `structured-tab.tsx`, `vf-segmented.tsx` —
  all 1.11a work, unchanged.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/slice-1.11-plan.md` — the stale
  decision 9 stays in the doc. See plan-doc reversal note above.

### Migrations + data applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_parent_case_id_slice_1_11b` — Phase 1. `parent_case_id`
  TEXT NULL + partial index on each of `nclex_bank_items` and
  `nclex_tutor_questions`.
- `mynclex_case_save_rpc_slice_1_11b` — Phase 4. The RPC. Verified
  via `pg_proc`: `pronargs = 4`.
- `mynclex_case_study_items_rls_slice_1_11b` — Phase 5. RLS
  enabled on both join tables, 2 policies each. Verified via
  `pg_class.relrowsecurity` + `pg_policies`.
- Seed rows: `NCLEX_MCQ_90001` / `NCLEX_MCQ_90002` /
  `NCLEX_SATA_90001` in `nclex_bank_items` (all with
  `parent_case_id = 'NCLEX_CS_00001'`, `is_builder_visible = TRUE`)
  + three matching rows in `nclex_case_study_items` at positions
  1 / 2 / 3 with the expected CJMM steps.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app lib` — clean.
- `npm run build` — clean. 19 routes, same as pre-slice.
- No browser test this session; Sam runs the dev worker.

### Known temporaries / deferrals

- **Accordion-label duplication** — "Content / Classification /
  Housekeeping" appears twice on the case editor (left: case
  wrapper, right: active slot). Cleanup scoped to a later slice.
- **Per-type editors stay FormData-driven** — the long-deferred
  conversion to controlled `value` / `onChange` components is
  still parked. Will likely surface when the student runner
  starts consuming bank items.
- **Preview-as-position button** — the disabled stub in the chart
  section still says "Slice 1.11c". That slice ships the in-editor
  student-view preview.
- **`?focus=` query param** — the admin/tutor bank list redirects
  case-linked edits to `/admin/bank/cases/[case_id]?focus=[item_id]`
  but the case editor doesn't yet open that slot on mount. Polish
  item for a follow-up.
- **Plan-doc hygiene** — `slice-1.11-plan.md` decision 9 still
  says `is_builder_visible = FALSE` on case-linked items. See the
  reversal note above. Plan doc gets refreshed in a later pass.

### Next session

- **Slice 1.11c** — preview-as-position, student-view in-editor.
- **Student runner** — unblocked by 1.11b; case runner now has
  real slots + join rows to consume.
- **`?focus=` slot auto-open** — small polish item; the link
  exists but the target page doesn't yet honour it.
- **Plan-doc sweep** — reconcile slice-1.11-plan.md with what
  1.11b actually shipped (decision 9 reversal + any others we
  encounter).

## Session — 2026-04-23 (Slice 1.11a fix — reorder CHECK constraint)

One-line: dropped `CHECK (display_order >= 0)` from both case-study
tab tables to unblock reorderTabsAction's negate-then-set swap.

Triggered by Sam's browser verification of 1.11a on dev — reorder
button hit `violates check constraint`.

### Files created
- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_case_study_tabs_display_order_fix.sql`

### Files modified
- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — removed `CHECK (display_order >= 0)`
  from `nclex_case_study_tabs` and `nclex_tutor_case_study_tabs`
  definitions.

### Database
- Dropped `nclex_case_study_tabs_display_order_check` from
  `nclex_case_study_tabs` (dev).
- Dropped `nclex_tutor_case_study_tabs_display_order_check` from
  `nclex_tutor_case_study_tabs` (dev).
- Prod catches up when the new migration is applied.

### Not done
- Prod is untouched. Sam runs the migration there when 1.11 lands
  as a whole.
- reorderTabsAction itself unchanged — the fix is at the schema
  layer, not the code layer.

### Next
- Sam resumes 1.11a verification checklist (Section G onwards).

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Slice 1.11a — Case Study case shell + tab authoring)

First of three Case Study sub-slices lands. A curator can now create
a named case study, add tabs (built-in or custom), fill entries with
`visible_from`, save, and list cases on both `/admin/bank/cases` and
`/tutor/bank/cases`. The 6 question slots on the right half of the
desktop split are a 1.11b placeholder — dashed-border pane, no
interactions.

Planning + handoff docs (`slice-1.11-plan.md`, `slice-1.11a-build-handoff.md`,
`mockups/case-study-editor-mockup.html`) landed in the repo at the
start of the session so Phase 0 had authoritative references to work
from.

### Decisions (locked before execution)

From the handoff doc, plus one clarification:

1. Custom tabs use `tab_key` = `'custom_narrative'` | `'custom_grid'`.
   Resolves a minor conflict between the handoff (two-key convention)
   and the mockup edge-case 6 (single `'custom'`). Two keys make the
   editor's renderer lookup one-step.
2. Flexible tab schema replaces the 6 hardcoded JSONB tab columns on
   both case tables.
3. Built-in tab types hardcoded in `lib/bank/case-study/tab-types.ts`
   — no DB registry.
4. Split-pane layout ≥ 900px, single-column below. Draggable divider,
   localStorage persists last width.
5. Case editor mounts its OWN shell (`lib/bank/case-study/editor.tsx`)
   — does NOT route through the bank's `EditorShell`.
6. Tab edits fire per-tab `upsertTabAction` / `deleteTabAction` calls,
   independent of case-header dirty state. Header saves via
   `updateCaseAction`.

### Phase 0 discrepancies found

- `slice-1.11-plan.md`, `slice-1.11a-build-handoff.md`, and the
  mockup HTML were NOT in the repo at session start. Sam pasted all
  three via the Downloads folder; Claude copied them into
  `mynclex/docs/product-plan/` (mockup into `mockups/`).
- `is_published` already present on both `nclex_case_studies` and
  `nclex_tutor_case_studies` from Slice 1 — handoff said "add if
  missing", confirmed already there, skipped the `ADD COLUMN`.
- No TS/TSX references to the 6 JSONB columns being dropped. Grep
  found them only in schema/docs. Safe to drop.
- `/admin/bank` has no existing section-card strip (unlike `/admin`).
  Handoff said "Match the section-card pattern already used on /admin
  and /admin/bank" — resolved by adding a `headerExtra` prop to
  `BankListView` and plugging a "Case Studies →" link into the
  browse-mode header on both `/admin/bank` and `/tutor/bank`.

### Files created

- `mynclex/db/migrations/mynclex_case_study_tabs_slice_1_11a.sql`
  — first tracked migration file in `mynclex/db/migrations/`. Drops
  6 columns × 2 tables, creates 2 child tab tables + 2 indexes.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/tab-types.ts` — hardcoded registry
  of the 6 built-ins + custom-tab discriminator helpers.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/types.ts` — `CaseStudyRow`,
  `CaseStudyTabRow`, `CaseStudyEntry`, `CaseStudyEditorInitial`, VF
  + grid-column bounds.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/actions.ts` — surface-aware server
  actions. Shape mirrors `app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts`:
  `surfaceConfig()`, `readSurface()`, `requireCaseCurator()`,
  `nextCaseId()`, `nextTabId()`, `createCaseAction`,
  `updateCaseAction`, `deleteCaseAction`, `upsertTabAction`,
  `deleteTabAction`, `reorderTabsAction`. Reorder uses a two-pass
  negate-then-set shift to dodge the UNIQUE (case_id, display_order)
  constraint mid-swap.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/vf-segmented.tsx` — visible-from
  1-6 segmented control, shared by both tab editors.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/narrative-tab.tsx` — stacked-cards
  editor used by built-in narrative tabs (nurses_notes / orders /
  history / diagnostics) and custom_narrative.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/structured-tab.tsx` — table editor
  used by built-in structured tabs (vital_signs / lab_results) and
  custom_grid. Embeds the ColumnBuilder pill row when rendering
  custom_grid.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/tab-rail.tsx` — left rail +
  AddTabPopover (built-ins with "Already added" disabled state;
  custom flow with name + Free text / Rows & columns shape picker).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/case-study/editor.tsx` — top-level
  `CaseStudyEditor` shell: sticky topbar, three `<details>`
  accordions (Content open, Classification, Housekeeping), split
  layout with draggable divider (localStorage persist), tab rail +
  active-tab editor, right-pane Q1-Q6 placeholder for 1.11b.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/cases/page.tsx` — admin cases list.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/cases/[case_id]/page.tsx` — admin
  case editor server wrapper.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/cases/page.tsx` — tutor cases list.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/cases/[case_id]/page.tsx` — tutor
  case editor server wrapper.
- `mynclex/db/seed-cases-dev.sql` — `NCLEX_CS_00001` demo case with
  three tabs (nurses_notes × 2 entries, vital_signs × 3 entries,
  custom_grid "Intake & Output" × 2 entries + 5 curator columns).
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/slice-1.11-plan.md`,
  `mynclex/docs/product-plan/slice-1.11a-build-handoff.md`,
  `mynclex/docs/product-plan/mockups/case-study-editor-mockup.html`
  — reference docs pasted in at session start.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — dropped 6 JSONB tab columns from both
  case tables; inserted `nclex_case_study_tabs` (as 6b, after the
  admin items join) and `nclex_tutor_case_study_tabs` (as 10b,
  after the tutor items join). Each table + its btree index.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — enabled RLS + 8 policies across the 4
  case-related tables. Admin cases + tabs: published-visibility for
  any authenticated user; `BANK_CURATE` (which short-circuits on
  `SUPER_ADMIN` via the existing helper) for full CRUD. Tutor cases
  + tabs: `tutor_id = auth.uid()` for full CRUD; `SUPER_ADMIN`
  bypass. Tutor tab policy chases parent case's tutor_id via
  EXISTS.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — added `CASE_ID_PREFIX` =
  `'NCLEX_CS_'` and `TUTOR_CASE_ID_PREFIX` = `'NCLEX_TUT_CS_'`
  constants alongside the question-type prefix maps.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/list-view.tsx` — new optional
  `headerExtra?: ReactNode` prop rendered inline in the browse-mode
  header. Zero behaviour change when the prop is absent.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — `headerExtra` plugged
  with "Case Studies →" link to `/admin/bank/cases`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/page.tsx` — same link to
  `/tutor/bank/cases`.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — appended `.cs-*` block (~650
  lines) for every case-study class: editor frame, sticky topbar,
  split frame + draggable divider, three accordions, chart section,
  tab rail with reorder arrows + custom badge, entries pane,
  structured table, narrative cards, VF segmented control, column
  builder pills, add-tab popover + shape picker, 1.11b right-pane
  placeholder, list page table + pills + banner, and a small
  header-extra wrapper for the bank browse header.

### Files NOT modified (explicitly)

- Every file under `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/` — the 9 per-type
  editors are untouched. Case Study wraps them in 1.11b.
- Every file under `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/types.ts` — case-study types stay in
  `lib/bank/case-study/types.ts`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/form-shape.ts` — that's bank-item form shape,
  not the case shape.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` and `actions.ts`
  — unchanged. Case Study does NOT mount through the bank's shell.
- `mynclex/app/landing.css` — landing page untouched.

### Migrations + data applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_case_study_tabs_slice_1_11a` — `{"success":true}`. 6
  `DROP COLUMN`s × 2 tables clean; both tab tables + both indexes
  present; defaults + nullability match.
- `mynclex_case_study_rls_slice_1_11a` — `{"success":true}`. 8
  policies present across the 4 case tables, verified via
  `pg_policies` query.
- `seed-cases-dev.sql` applied inline — `NCLEX_CS_00001` + 3 tabs
  (entry_count 2/3/2, column_count 0/0/5) verified via SELECT.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app lib` — clean after two fix rounds. First pass
  surfaced 12 errors from React 19 / compiler lint rules:
  setState-in-effect (×5), ref mutation during render (×1),
  access-before-declared (×1), unescaped-entities (×3), plus 2
  narrow-tab setState-in-effect. Fixes:
  - Narrative/structured tab error clear: moved into each mutator
    inline (no effect).
  - Editor draft sync: replaced mount-effect + tabsSorted sync
    with a derived `drafts` map from `tabsSorted` + an
    `draftOverrides` state.
  - Editor active-tab reset: moved from effect to during-render
    conditional setState (React-documented pattern).
  - Editor header-dirty reset: folded into `onSaveCase`'s success
    branch.
  - Editor category cascade: replaced effect-based sync with
    during-render compare-prev-prop pattern.
  - Editor split drag: removed `useCallback` handlers + ref
    mutation. Replaced with inline closures created per-drag, so
    `onMove` / `onUp` share closure state (startX, startPct,
    lastPct) directly.
  - Editor localStorage init: kept in effect with a single
    `eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
    (intentional external-state sync; the only alternative is to
    risk a hydration mismatch).
- `npm run build` (webpack) — clean. 19 routes total, 4 new:
  `/admin/bank/cases`, `/admin/bank/cases/[case_id]`, tutor twins.
  All existing routes still compile.
- Did NOT browser-test end-to-end. Sam runs dev worker.

### Deferred to future sessions / out of scope here

- **Slice 1.11b — 6 question slots.** Right-half navigator +
  nested per-type editor + `parent_case_id` column on bank_items
  and tutor_questions + transactional save of header + children.
- **Slice 1.11c — Preview-as-position + validation polish.** The
  editor has a disabled "Preview as student · position 1" stub
  button reserved for this.
- **Reorder tabs via drag-and-drop.** Up/down arrows only in v1,
  matches curriculum editor convention.
- **Image attachments on chart entries.** Same deferral as bank
  items — image upload pipeline isn't wired yet.
- **Typed flag column for Lab Results.** Currently free text so
  non-numeric lab values work ("positive", "sinus rhythm").
- **Tutor cross-linking.** Tutor case studies link only tutor
  questions, not admin. Confirmed in plan decision 11.

### Next session

Options:
- **Slice 1.11b** — the 6 question slots, now unblocked.
- **Student runner** — still unblocked from Slice 1.10; case
  runner is blocked on 1.11b.
- **UX polish pass** — Sam's verification on dev may surface
  small pain points in the tab authoring surface.

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Planning — Trend promoted to v1)

No code written. Single-decision entry: Trend items promoted from
v2 (deferred) to v1 (queued for build after Case Study).

### Decision

Sam reviewed the Case Study vs Trend scope during close-out of the
Slice 1.10 session. Reasoning:

- Case Study is architecturally harder than Trend (new table + join
  table + 6 JSONB chart tabs + progressive-unfold rendering vs
  Trend's single new table + nullable FK).
- Trend reuses the wrapper pattern Case Study will establish.
- The Trend shape is already fully spec'd from the 22 April planning
  session (`bank.md § Trend items — planned shape`, plus the
  `mockups/trend-visualisation.html` mockup).
- Marginal build cost for Trend on top of Case Study is smaller
  than building it as an isolated v2 project later.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/main.md` — removed Trend from the
  "Deferred (v2 or later)" list.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — updated the question-types
  table note ("TREND is a wrapper, not a standalone type"), renamed
  the Trend section (dropped `(v2)` qualifier), added a promotion
  paragraph, and updated the "Decisions not yet settled" cross-
  reference to drop the v2 wording.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/mockups/trend-visualisation.html` —
  doc-meta, "Why deferred" section heading, callout update paragraph,
  and footer all updated to reflect v1 promotion.

### Files NOT modified

- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — no schema changes; Trend schema comes
  with Slice 1.12.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — no RLS changes.
- Every file under `mynclex/lib/bank/` and `mynclex/app/(app)/` —
  zero code changes.

### Verified

- Nothing to run. Documentation-only session.

### Next session

Start Slice 1.11 — Case Study wrapper planning. Open question at
that session's start: do we split Slice 1.11 into 1.11a/1.11b/1.11c
(schema + editor shell / item picker / chart tabs) or attempt as
one slice? Sam + Claude decide based on scope read after first
round of discussion.

---

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Slice 1.10 — Drag-drop authoring)

Ninth and last standalone question type lands. With DRAG_DROP live,
all 9 types are authorable end-to-end on both `/admin/bank` and
`/tutor/bank` — only the case-study wrapper (Slice 1.11) and the
student runner remain before Family B is complete.

Both subtypes — ORDERED (ranked positions) and SENTENCE (inline `[N]`
markers in the stem) — share one JSONB shape discriminated by
`content.subtype`. Slice 2.1's surface plumbing carried the tutor
side for free: zero files touched under `/tutor/bank`, and the tutor
prefix `NCLEX_TUT_DD_` is wired via `TUTOR_ITEM_ID_PREFIX`.

### Decisions (locked before execution)

Structural (locked in earlier planning):
1. Two subtypes via `content.subtype` = `'ORDERED'` | `'SENTENCE'`.
2. Curator picks pool size per question; distractors allowed.
3. Each token fills at most one slot — no reuse.
4. Slot bounds 3–8.
5. Token bounds N to min(N+4, 12) where N = active slot count.
6. Feedback granularity: per-slot, optional (sparse map).
7. Slot IDs `s1, s2, …` (position-based).
8. Token IDs `t1, t2, …`.
9. Answer shape `correct.slots = { s1: "t3", ... }`.

Locked via mockup on 2026-04-22:

10. Sentence marker syntax `[N]` — positive integer in single square
    brackets. Shared regex `/\[(\d+)\]/g` in editor + parser.
11. Pool size rule: `tokens.length >= slots.length AND tokens.length
    <= min(slots.length + 4, 12)`.

Implementation calls:

12. Curator slot-assignment via `<select>` per slot (dropdown + `—
    none —` default). No DnD inside the curator; student runner
    will handle drag interactivity.
13. Subtype switch mid-edit: `window.confirm()` prompt, then reset
    slots + tokens. Stem text is preserved (curator may want to keep
    the sentence), but orphan slot cards would be meaningless after
    a subtype flip so they go.

Standing conventions:

14. Item-ID prefixes: `NCLEX_DD_` (admin), `NCLEX_TUT_DD_` (tutor) —
    added to both `ITEM_ID_PREFIX` and `TUTOR_ITEM_ID_PREFIX`.
15. Instruction field inherited via shell (Slice 1.8). No per-editor
    handling.
16. Tutor surface inherits automatically via Slice 2.1 plumbing.
17. `VALID_TYPES` drift point — added `'DRAG_DROP'` first before any
    other actions.ts change.

### Phase 0 discrepancies found

- Drag-drop mockup wasn't in-repo (Sam provided on desktop). Copied
  into `mynclex/docs/product-plan/mockups/drag-drop-editor-mockup.html`
  so bank.md + CSS references resolve.
- `rowToInitial()` now lives in `mynclex/lib/bank/list-view.tsx`
  (moved by Slice 2.1). Handoff said `app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx`;
  added the DRAG_DROP branch + `dd_*` fields in list-view.tsx
  instead.
- `types.ts` was missing the DragDrop shapes — added
  `DragDropContent` + `DragDropCorrect` and extended `BankItemContent`
  / `BankItemCorrect` unions. Parent interfaces `DragDropSlot` +
  `DragDropToken` added for reuse.
- `parsers/index.ts` switch is exhaustive — the DRAG_DROP case was
  mandatory, not optional.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/drag-drop.ts` — pure parser. 6 phases:
  subtype validation, SENTENCE `[N]` extraction (1..8, unique), slot
  bounds, token bounds + non-empty text, assignment validity (every
  active slot has a pool-resident token, no reuse), final shape
  build. Stem is byte-preserved.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/drag-drop-editor.tsx` — client editor.
  `SubtypeRadio`, SENTENCE-only `Stem toolbar` with `+ Slot marker`
  (finds lowest free N in 1..8 and inserts at cursor via
  `document.getElementById('bank-stem')`), `SlotsEditor` + `SlotCard`
  (active vs orphan rendering, add/remove on ORDERED), `TokenPoolEditor`
  (+ Add / × Remove, min 1, hard max 12), `BoundsMeter` (ok / warn /
  err), hidden serialisers for every field. Subtype switch calls
  `window.confirm` then resets slots + tokens. Stem stays.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/mockups/drag-drop-editor-mockup.html` —
  copied from Sam's desktop into the repo.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — `QUESTION_TYPES` + both
  prefix maps + new bounds constants (`MIN_DD_SLOTS`, `MAX_DD_SLOTS`,
  `DEFAULT_DD_SLOTS`, `DD_TOKEN_POOL_MAX_OVER_SLOTS`,
  `DD_TOKEN_POOL_ABSOLUTE_MAX`, `DD_TOKEN_POOL_MIN_EXTRA`).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/types.ts` — `DragDropSlot` / `DragDropToken` /
  `DragDropContent` / `DragDropCorrect`; both unions extended.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/form-shape.ts` — `dd_subtype` / `dd_slots` /
  `dd_tokens` on `BankFormInitial`; defaults on `emptyInitial()`
  (ORDERED, 3 scaffold slots, 3 empty tokens).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/index.ts` — `DragDropSlotInput` /
  `DragDropTokenInput` imports, `dragDrop` param on dispatcher,
  `DRAG_DROP` case.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts` — `'DRAG_DROP'` added
  to `VALID_TYPES` first (drift point discipline kept); 6 new
  FormData extraction lines + one `dragDrop` key passed into
  `parseByType`. Surface + role gate untouched.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — `DragDropEditor`
  import + DRAG_DROP case in `renderEditor()`. No other changes to
  the shell.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/list-view.tsx` — new `dd_subtype` / `dd_slots` /
  `dd_tokens` locals with matching defaults; DRAG_DROP branch in
  `rowToInitial()` that reads `content.subtype` / `content.slots` /
  `content.tokens` and merges `correct.slots` + `correct.feedback`
  back into the flat card shape. Returned `BankFormInitial` now
  includes the 3 new dd_* fields.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — appended `.bank-dd-*` block (~180
  lines). Uses the project's actual tokens (`--primary`, `--accent`,
  `--border`, `--white`, `--bg`, `--text-muted`) + inline hex for
  state colours (teal-chip, amber, warn, danger) — matches the
  convention established by `.bt-*` / `.bank-cz-*` / `.bank-hl-*`.
- `mynclex/db/seed-bank-dev.sql` — appended seed rows 13 + 14.
  Row 13 (`NCLEX_DD_00001`, ORDERED, Post-op deteriorating client,
  5 slots / 6 tokens / 1 distractor, instruction populated) landed
  in the main commit; row 14 (`NCLEX_DD_00002`, SENTENCE, stroke
  recognition, 3 slots / 6 tokens / 3 distractors) was appended in
  a follow-up commit so both subtypes ship in dev.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — build-order step 7 unparked;
  Drag-drop `content` and `correct` example blocks added to the
  JSONB shape list alongside MCQ / Matrix / Bow-tie / Cloze /
  Highlight, with paragraphs explaining the two-subtype
  discriminator, pool-size rule, and no-renumber decision.

### Files NOT modified (reuse inheritance from Slice 2.1)

- All 8 existing editors in `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/`.
- All 8 existing parsers in `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/page.tsx` — zero changes. Tutor
  surface picks up DRAG_DROP via `TUTOR_ITEM_ID_PREFIX` + the
  shared actions.ts branching.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/layout.tsx`, `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/page.tsx`.

### Migration applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_bank_dragdrop_seed_slice_1_10` — `{"success":true}`.
  Verified: subtype=ORDERED, 5 slots, 6 tokens, 5 correct mappings,
  instruction populated.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` — clean.
- `npm run build` (webpack) — clean. All 14 routes compile
  including the unchanged `/tutor/bank`.

### Verified by Sam on dev Worker

1. Smoke + list — PASS. `NCLEX_DD_00001` and `NCLEX_DD_00002`
   visible in `/admin/bank` with DRAG_DROP type pill; filter option
   works.
2. Edit round-trip ORDERED — PASS. All fields pre-fill correctly
   on `NCLEX_DD_00001`; bounds meter shows the expected counter.
3. Create ORDERED — PASS. New row saves with correct `NCLEX_DD_*`
   prefix.
4. Create SENTENCE — PASS. `+ Slot marker` button inserts `[N]` at
   cursor; subtype warn-dialog fires on switch; save round-trips.
5. Rejection cases — PASS. All 6 failure modes correctly blocked
   by editor or parser with clear messages.
6. Tutor-side smoke — PASS. `mynclextutor` authored a DRAG_DROP
   with `NCLEX_TUT_DD_*` prefix; zero tutor-side code changes
   needed. Slice 2.1's reuse architecture holds for drag-drop.

### UX observations (deferred, not blocking)

- **Drag-drop editor feels less polished than other Family B
  editors.** Sam noted during verification that the subtype toggle
  is not as conspicuous as it could be, and that the editor lacks a
  preview mode that Bow-tie, Matrix, and similar types have. The
  editor is functional — every verification phase passed — but it's
  the roughest Family B interface. Revisit after real curator use
  surfaces concrete pain points.
- **Shared-shell stem-state refactor now triples as a cost.** Three
  editors (Cloze, Highlight, Drag-drop) use
  `document.getElementById('bank-stem')` to reach the stem textarea.
  Flagged on prior slices; tripled now. Lift into shared shell
  state the next time any editor needs stem access.

### Deferred to future sessions / out of scope here

- **Slice 1.11 — case-study wrapper.** Groups 6 questions under
  shared scenario + chart tabs. Needs `nclex_case_studies` +
  `nclex_case_study_items` to be wired; tutor parallels already in
  schema.
- **Student runner** — now unblocked for all 9 types.
- **CLONING.md update** — still doesn't exist; same deferral as
  Slices 1.5–2.1.
- **Lift stem into shared shell state** — third editor to use the
  `document.getElementById('bank-stem')` pattern (Cloze / Highlight /
  Drag-drop). Worth refactoring in a standalone cleanup slice.
- **Duplicate-text-token independence** — the parser rejects two
  slots with the same assigned_token_id; if two *different* slot
  positions need independent same-text tokens, the curator must add
  two separate pool entries (`t3: "Call provider"`, `t4: "Call
  provider"`). Acceptable v1 trade-off — flagged if it bites.

### Next session

Options:
- **Slice 1.11** — case-study wrapper.
- **Student runner** — now unblocked.
- **Lift stem into shared shell state** — cleanup slice, one
  refactor touches Cloze + Highlight + Drag-drop.

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Slice 2.1 — Tutor-side bank authoring / reusability proof)

First slice of Bank v2 work — stand up tutor-side authoring on
`nclex_tutor_questions` without touching the 8 per-type editors, 8
parsers, `types.ts`, or `form-shape.ts`. The reusability claim made
across Slices 1.3–1.9 either lands or doesn't here. It landed.

### Decisions (locked before execution)

1. **Dual-table approach:** shared `actions.ts` with a `surface`
   parameter (Approach A). No parallel tutor actions file.
2. **ID prefix:** `NCLEX_TUT_<TYPE>_NNNNN` — e.g. `NCLEX_TUT_MCQ_00001`.
3. **Seed:** four Family A tutor rows (MCQ, TF, SATA, SELECT_N) bound
   to Sam's dev tutor account
   (`mybackpacc+mynclextutor@gmail.com`, UUID
   `4ed777d7-e4f7-403b-88f4-63ce5432d65e`).
4. **List-view:** extracted into a shared component
   (`lib/bank/list-view.tsx`) that both `/admin/bank` and
   `/tutor/bank` mount.
5. **Two-pass extraction:** Pass A — extract without behaviour change,
   admin still works identically. Pass B — mount on tutor page.
   Verified the build was clean after each pass before moving on.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/list-view.tsx` — shared `BankListView` component
  (browse + focus mode) plus `rowToInitial()` + `buildFilterQueryString()`
  helpers and the `BankRow` / `FullBankRow` / `BankSearchParams`
  types. `editor` arrives as a `ReactNode` prop so the list-view has
  zero dependency on `@/app/...`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/filters.tsx` — moved from
  `app/(app)/admin/bank/filters.tsx`. Gained a `baseUrl` prop so the
  GET form posts back to the owning surface; behaviour otherwise
  identical.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/navigator.tsx` — moved from
  `app/(app)/admin/bank/navigator.tsx`. Gained a `baseUrl` prop for
  the back-link + per-row `edit=` hrefs.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/layout.tsx` — TUTOR role gate for the
  entire `/tutor` tree. The (app) layout already enforces
  authenticated access and renders chrome; this layer just adds the
  role requirement. Defensive `if (!user) redirect('/login')` kept.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/bank/page.tsx` — tutor Question Bank page.
  Mirrors `/admin/bank/page.tsx`: same filter+limit query shape, same
  `rowToInitial()` call, same render; only the table
  (`nclex_tutor_questions`) and the explicit
  `.eq('tutor_id', user.id)` differ. Mounts
  `<EditorShell surface="tutor" … />` so writes route correctly.
- `mynclex/db/seed-tutor-bank-dev.sql` — four seed rows with the
  correct JSONB shapes for MCQ / TF / SATA / SELECT_N. Only
  `NCLEX_TUT_SATA_00001` carries an `instruction` (round-trip
  coverage for the 1.8 column). All rows `is_published=false`.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — added
  `TUTOR_ITEM_ID_PREFIX` map (one entry per QuestionType). Existing
  `ITEM_ID_PREFIX` left unchanged.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — enabled RLS on `nclex_tutor_questions` +
  two policies: `nclex_tutor_questions_tutor_own` (FOR ALL,
  `tutor_id = auth.uid()`) and `nclex_tutor_questions_superadmin`
  (FOR ALL, `nclex_user_has_role('SUPER_ADMIN')`). Placed directly
  below the existing `nclex_bank_items` section so related tables
  stay together in the file.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts` — surface-aware rewrite:
  - New `Surface = 'admin' | 'tutor'` type + `surfaceConfig()` helper
    that maps surface → table name, ID-prefix map, redirect base URL.
  - `readSurface(formData)` reads the hidden field; defaults to
    `'admin'` on anything unexpected (belt-and-braces).
  - `requireBankCurator()` → `requireSurfaceAuth(surface)`. Admin
    path unchanged (BANK_CURATE / SUPER_ADMIN → `/admin`). Tutor
    path: require TUTOR role → `/no-access`.
  - `nextItemId(supabase, surface, type)` — third arg picks prefix
    map + table to scan.
  - CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE each read surface, pick the table via
    `surfaceConfig(surface).table`, and CREATE also sets
    `tutor_id = user.id` when surface is tutor. RLS enforces the same
    invariant at the DB layer regardless.
  - `redirect()` + `revalidatePath()` use `surfaceConfig.baseUrl` so
    the caller lands back on the owning surface.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — the ONLY edit
  here is what Phase 4 explicitly required:
  - New optional `surface?: 'admin' | 'tutor'` prop, default `'admin'`
    so the existing admin callsite keeps working.
  - `<input type="hidden" name="surface" value={surface} />` so the
    server action can read it on submit.
  - Synthetic FormData in `onDelete()` now also sets `surface` so
    delete picks the right table.
  - Total diff: ~5 lines. Editor renderers, section layout, type
    select, and the per-type editor wiring all byte-identical.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — collapsed from ~595
  lines to ~155. Role gate + nclex_bank_items fetch + initial-row
  load stay here (surface-specific). Everything else delegated to
  `<BankListView surface="admin" baseUrl="/admin/bank" … />` with
  `<EditorShell surface="admin" …/>` passed as the focus-mode
  `editor` ReactNode.

  `lib/bank/filters.tsx`).
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/navigator.tsx` (moved to
  `lib/bank/navigator.tsx`).

### Migrations applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_bank_tutor_rls_slice_2_1` — `{"success":true}`.
  Enables RLS on `nclex_tutor_questions`, adds the two policies.
- `mynclex_bank_tutor_seed_slice_2_1` — `{"success":true}` on the
  second attempt. First attempt failed on a stray `isn't` apostrophe
  inside a single-quoted SQL literal; fixed by doubling to `isn''t`.
  Backported the same fix to `seed-tutor-bank-dev.sql`.

Verified post-seed with SELECT: 4 rows, all bound to the right
`tutor_id`, `is_published=false` across the board,
`instruction='Select ALL that apply.'` on the SATA row only.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean after Pass A; clean again after Phase 5.
- `npx eslint app/(app)/admin/bank app/(app)/tutor lib/bank` —
  clean both runs.
- `npm run build` (webpack) — clean both runs. Final route listing
  includes the new `/tutor/bank` entry alongside the existing
  `/admin/bank` and the rest of the app tree.

### Findings

- **Editor-shell edit was unavoidable, but minimal.** Phase 4.1
  offered two ways to pass surface: first action arg, or hidden
  FormData field. FormData field matches the existing pattern
  (question_type, item_id are all hidden fields already), so the
  shell gained a single hidden input + a 5-line type widening on
  its props. No logic changes. Documented per the handoff's "if
  it does, treat that as a finding" rule.
- **`admin/bank/form.tsx` is now dead code.** It was a thin
  `BankForm` wrapper around `EditorShell`. Nothing imports it
  anymore after the page refactor. Left untouched this slice per
  the repo rule *"Don't clean up surrounding code"*; logged here
  for a future cleanup pass.
- **Option (ii) taken for Phase 5.3.** No second `tutor/bank/actions.ts`
  wrapper file. The tutor page imports `EditorShell` directly from
  `@/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell` and passes `surface='tutor'`;
  the shared action reads that from FormData. Cross-import is
  deliberate.

### Not yet verified (Sam's session, on dev Worker)

Per the handoff, browser verification is Sam's job:

1. Log in as admin — `/admin/bank` still works exactly as before.
   Create one MCQ, edit it, delete it. No regressions.
2. Log in as tutor (`mybackpacc+mynclextutor@gmail.com`) — go to
   `/tutor/bank`. Confirm the 4 seeded rows appear.
   Confirm admin rows do **not** appear (RLS isolation).
3. Create one of each 8 types as tutor. Confirm all save with
   `NCLEX_TUT_*` IDs.
4. Edit one of each 8. Confirm round-trip.
5. Delete one. Confirm removal.
6. Log in as a second tutor (you may need to create one) — confirm
   the first tutor's rows are invisible.
7. Log in as STUDENT — confirm `/tutor/bank` redirects to `/no-access`.

### Deferred to future sessions / out of scope here

- **Drag-drop (Slice 1.10)** — still parked, to resume soon.
  Eight of nine types are authorable on both admin and tutor
  surfaces now; Drag-drop will land on both simultaneously via the
  surface plumbing shipped here.
- **CLONING.md update** — still doesn't exist; same deferral as
  Slices 1.5–1.9.
- **Student runner** — unblocked by the full Family B set once
  Drag-drop lands.
- **Case-study wrapper (Slice 1.11)** — the `nclex_tutor_case_studies`
  + join tables already exist per schema.sql; will need a parallel
  surface-aware treatment when the case-study surface is built.
- **Dead code cleanup** — `admin/bank/form.tsx` (no callers).

### Next session

Options:
- Resume Drag-drop (Slice 1.10) with the 3 already-locked decisions.
- Keep proving surface symmetry by adding Family B authoring to the
  tutor surface (should be zero-cost — same reusability proof).
- Start the student runner on the 8 live types.

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Planning — Trend items v2 + Drag-drop park)

No code written. Planning-only session covering two things:

1. **Slice 1.10 (Drag-drop) formally parked.** Earlier this session we
   had started Slice 1.10 planning and captured 3 decisions (both
   Ordered-list + Sentence-slots subtypes via `content.subtype` radio;
   curator picks pool size per question including distractors; each
   token fills one slot max). Sam chose to park and pivot before
   writing the mockup. Outstanding decisions when we resume: sentence
   slot-marker syntax (leaning `[1]` `[2]`), slot bounds (3–8
   confirmed), feedback granularity (per-slot confirmed), pool-size
   rule (recommended slot-count up to slot-count + 4), correct-answer
   shape (recommended `correct.slots = { s1: "t3", ... }`). **To
   resume very soon — this is the next in-flight build item.**

2. **Trend items (v2) planned shape settled.** Sam asked to visualise
   what a Trend item would look like; built a 4-example mockup
   (`mockups/trend-visualisation.html`) showing vitals-over-time +
   Matrix, labs-over-days + Cloze, I&O-over-shifts + Highlight, and
   neuro-progression + SATA. Through that mockup, the shape settled:
   Trend is structurally similar to Case Study — its clinical context
   (the time-series table) lives in its own table and joins to one
   bank item via a nullable FK. Documented in `bank.md` under new
   section "Trend items (v2) — planned shape".

### Decisions (Trend v2)

- **Own table:** `nclex_trend_datasets` — `trend_id` PK, title,
  scenario, kind (vitals/labs/io/neuro/assessment), timepoints JSONB
  array, rows JSONB array of `{metric, values, flags}`, plus
  classification subset.
- **Attachment mechanism:** nullable `trend_id TEXT FK` column on
  `nclex_bank_items` (and parallel on `nclex_tutor_questions` via
  `nclex_tutor_trend_datasets`).
- **No new question type.** Trend items re-use the existing 9 types;
  the presence of `trend_id` is the render switch.
- **One trend → many items allowed.** Same trend dataset can pair
  with a Matrix, a Cloze, and a SATA — reuse without copy-paste.
- **Simpler than Case Study's join.** Trend is a one-to-one
  attachment from the item's side, so a plain FK suffices; no join
  table needed (unlike Case Study's position + cjmm_step pair).
- **Build cost when v2 starts:** one ALTER TABLE, new `/admin/trends`
  page, new trend editor, dropdown on bank-item editor, runner
  enhancement to render the panel.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — replaced one-line
  "Trend items (v2)." entry under "Decisions not yet settled" with
  a full `## Trend items (v2) — planned shape` section (~150 lines,
  incl. schema sketch and mockup reference). Also updated build-
  order step 7 to flag drag-drop as parked.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/mockups/trend-visualisation.html` —
  new file. 989-line static mockup matching `ngn-primer.html`'s
  style tokens (Fraunces + Inter, navy/teal palette). 4 trend
  examples + conceptual framing + future-shape sketch.
- `mynclex/SESSIONS.md` — this entry.

### Files unchanged (explicitly)

- Every file under `mynclex/lib/bank/` — planning only.
- Every file under `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/` — planning only.
- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — no schema changes this session.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — no RLS changes this session.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/main.md` — already lists "Trend items
  (NGN variant...)" under "Deferred (v2 or later)"; no update needed
  there (main.md is the index, bank.md is the detail).

### Verified

- Nothing to run — planning-only session, no TS, no SQL, no routes
  touched.

### Deferred to future sessions

- **Drag-drop (Slice 1.10)** — to resume very soon. 3 decisions
  locked, 2 still open (sentence marker syntax, pool-size rule).
- **CLONING.md update** — still doesn't exist; deferred since Slice
  1.5.
- **Student runner** — unblocks after all Family B editors are live.
- **Case-study wrapper (Slice 1.11).**

### Next session

Resume Slice 1.10 (Drag-drop). Start with the mockup, using the 3
already-locked decisions and closing the 2 open ones (Q1 sentence
marker syntax + Q3 pool-size rule).

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Slice 1.9 — Highlight authoring)

Fourth Family B question type. `[[double-bracket]]` chunk syntax on
top of the stem, with per-chunk correctness toggles. Simpler than
Cloze — brackets carry their own text so no stem renumbering is
needed; the parser produces a byte-identical stem and only
normalises chunk metadata. Plan drafted in Claude Web; executed
from a pre-written handoff file.

### Decisions (from Claude Web discussion)

- **Storage.** Passage stored in top-level `stem` column with
  `[[chunk]]` syntax intact; `content.chunks` lists one entry per
  bracket pair in passage order; `correct.correct_ids` is a flat
  list; `correct.feedback` is flat (unlike Cloze's nested per-blank
  map — Highlight chunks don't restart IDs per anything).
- **Double brackets** distinguish markers from literal single-bracket
  notation. Medical text like `[K⁺] = 3.2` or `[diagnosis TBD]` is
  safe passage content. Inner single brackets allowed inside a chunk
  (`[[low Hgb [<10 g/dL]]]`) — handled by the non-greedy regex
  `/\[\[(.+?)\]\]/g`.
- **Non-greedy matching is non-negotiable.** A greedy pattern would
  span `[[foo]]bar[[baz]]` as one match and break the type.
- **Stable positional IDs.** `h1`, `h2`, … assigned in passage order
  at save time. Independent of chunk text — curator can edit the
  text inside `[[...]]` without breaking feedback references.
- **Smart Wrap / Insert button** — dual-behaviour toolbar button.
  With a selection it wraps (`[[ ]]` around selected text, cursor
  after `]]`); without selection it inserts empty `[[]]` at cursor
  and places the caret between the inner brackets so the curator
  types the chunk text directly.
- **Orphan preservation (Option II, same as Cloze).** Removing
  `[[...]]` from the passage greys out the card as "will be dropped
  on save" but keeps the correctness + feedback; re-bracketing the
  same text reconnects it. Parser drops `in_passage=false` cards at
  save time.
- **Colour-coded preview** — author-facing answer key with green
  (correct) / grey (wrong) / dashed-amber (undecided) pills, plus a
  legend below the passage.
- **Bounds summary bar** — four pills showing chunk / correct /
  wrong / undecided counts, each flipping green when its constraint
  is met.
- **Bounds.** 3–12 chunks, ≥1 correct, ≥1 wrong. The wrong-chunk
  floor enforces distractors so "click everything = 100%" is
  impossible.
- **Duplicate-text handling.** If the curator has `[[118]]` twice
  (e.g. HR at two timestamps), both spans get the same decision +
  feedback — the parser keys by text. Truly independent dupes are
  out of scope (would need per-position FormData IDs); flagged in
  deferrals.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/highlight.ts` — non-greedy bracket
  extraction, positional ID assignment, bounds validation, orphan
  drop. Stem passes through byte-identical (no renumber needed).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/highlight-editor.tsx` — toolbar (Wrap /
  Insert + Clear all + chunk-count pill), smart-tip, preview with
  legend, bounds summary, per-chunk cards with ✓/✗ toggle + feedback
  textarea, orphan state, hidden serialisers.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — HIGHLIGHT added to
  `QUESTION_TYPES` + `ITEM_ID_PREFIX`; `HIGHLIGHT_MIN_CHUNKS` /
  `HIGHLIGHT_MAX_CHUNKS` / `HIGHLIGHT_MIN_CORRECT` /
  `HIGHLIGHT_MIN_WRONG` constants.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/types.ts` — `HighlightChunk` /
  `HighlightContent` / `HighlightCorrect`; union extensions.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/form-shape.ts` — `highlight_chunks` array on
  `BankFormInitial`; default `[]` in `emptyInitial()` (empty
  scaffold — chunks are extracted from bracketing, not pre-seeded).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/index.ts` — `HighlightChunkInput`
  import, `highlight?: { stem; chunks }` on dispatcher params,
  HIGHLIGHT branch.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts` — `'HIGHLIGHT'` added
  to `VALID_TYPES` (drift-point streak kept — caught on first pass);
  `HighlightChunkInput` import; 5-array FormData extraction block
  with decision narrowed to the string union.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — `HighlightEditor`
  import + HIGHLIGHT case in `renderEditor()`. Stem textarea already
  had `id="bank-stem"` from Slice 1.8; no shell change needed.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — `highlight_chunks`
  local + HIGHLIGHT branch in `rowToInitial()` (decision = `correct`
  iff chunk ID is in `correct_ids`, else `wrong` — persisted rows
  never have `'undecided'` because the parser rejects that at save
  time); `highlight_chunks` included in returned `BankFormInitial`.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — `bank-hl-*` block appended:
  toolbar, smart-tip, preview with colour-coded chunks + legend,
  bounds summary, chunk cards with correct / wrong / warn / orphan
  variants, toggle button group, feedback textarea. Family A +
  Matrix + Bow-tie + Cloze CSS untouched.
- `mynclex/db/seed-bank-dev.sql` — one HIGHLIGHT seed row
  (`NCLEX_HL_00001`, "Post-op vitals", 5 chunks / 3 correct).
  Added as a separate standalone INSERT rather than extending the
  main multi-row batch, so the `instruction` column can be
  populated without touching the shared header — **first seed to
  use the `instruction` column** landed in Slice 1.7.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — Highlight `content` /
  `correct` examples rewritten to the new `chunks` + `correct_ids`
  + flat-feedback shape; paragraphs explain the double-bracket
  syntax, non-greedy regex, positional IDs, and distractor floor.

### Migrations applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_bank_highlight_seed_slice_1_9` — standalone INSERT.
  Returned `{"success":true}`. Verified: 5 chunks, 3 correct_ids,
  instruction populated with "Highlight the findings that require
  immediate action."

### Drift caught during execution

- **`VALID_TYPES`** — flagged in the handoff as a known drift
  point. Added `'HIGHLIGHT'` on first pass; streak kept.
- **Non-greedy regex** — defined once as `const BRACKET_RE =
  /\[\[(.+?)\]\]/g` in both `parsers/highlight.ts` and
  `editors/highlight-editor.tsx`. Both use `value.matchAll(...)` so
  no `lastIndex` mutation inside a React component (same lesson
  from Slice 1.8's ESLint `react-hooks/immutability` catch).
- **Separate INSERT for seed.** The existing seed batch uses a
  shared 19-column header that predates `instruction`. Extending
  the header would have required adding `NULL` to every existing
  row (churn). Chose a separate INSERT with a wider column list for
  the new row — keeps the slice diff small and sets the pattern
  for future seeds that need new columns.

### Verified

- Migration applied successfully to dev Supabase.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` — clean.
- `npm run build` (webpack) — clean. Every route still compiles:
  `/`, `/admin`, `/admin/bank`, `/admin/payments`, `/login`,
  `/logout`, `/no-access`, `/pick-role`, `/register`, `/router`,
  `/student`, `/tutor` + proxy middleware.

### Not yet verified (Sam's session, on dev Worker)

Per the handoff, browser verification is a separate 5-phase pass:

1. Smoke + list — `NCLEX_HL_00001` appears with HIGHLIGHT pill.
2. Edit round-trip — all 5 chunks pre-fill with correct decisions
   (h2 / h3 / h5 = green, h1 / h4 = grey); instruction shows the
   saved text; preview renders colour-coded.
3. Create flow — smart button with and without selection; add 3+
   chunks; toggle decisions; save → `NCLEX_HL_00002`.
4. Orphan preservation — delete `[[184/96]]` brackets; card h2
   greys out; re-wrap `184/96`; card reconnects.
5. Rejection cases — <3 chunks; all correct; all wrong; undecided.

### Deferred to future sessions / out of scope here

- **CLONING.md update** — file still doesn't exist; same deferral
  as Slices 1.5–1.8.
- **Drag-drop (Slice 1.10)** — ordered slot filling; last
  stand-alone Family B type.
- **Case-study wrapper (Slice 1.11)** — 6 questions + chart tabs
  under a shared scenario.
- **Student runner** — now unblocked for all 8 standalone types
  (MCQ, TF, SATA, SELECT_N, MATRIX, BOWTIE, CLOZE, HIGHLIGHT) once
  Drag-drop lands.
- **Truly independent duplicate-text chunks** — currently two
  `[[118]]` spans share a decision + feedback. Making them
  independent requires per-position FormData IDs and a parser
  change; flagged here for when a curator actually hits the case.
- **Lift stem into shared shell state** — the `getElementById`
  pattern is now used by both Cloze and Highlight. If a third
  type needs it, time to refactor.

### Next session

Options:
- (a) Drag-drop (Slice 1.10) — finishes the stand-alone Family B
  set, unblocks the student runner.
- (b) Case-study wrapper (Slice 1.11) — more architectural;
  requires the `nclex_case_studies` + join tables work too.
- (c) Student runner — start consuming the 8 live types
  end-to-end; still needs Drag-drop to cover Family B completely.

Per the handoff's trajectory, Drag-drop is the natural next — the
last editor before the runner.

---

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Slice 1.8 — Cloze authoring + Instruction wiring)

Two tightly-coupled pieces shipped as one commit: Slice 1.7's orphan
`instruction` column is now surfaced in the shell, and CLOZE — the
third Family B question type — has end-to-end authoring (create / edit
/ delete, plus a seeded Heart-Failure example). Plan drafted in Claude
Web; executed from a pre-written handoff file.

### Decisions (from Claude Web discussion)

**Instruction wiring**
- Shell-level field, not per-type — one textarea at the top of Content,
  inherited by every editor.
- Optional on every type; empty input stores as `NULL` (DB column
  distinguishes "never set" from "explicitly blank").
- Amber-accented card with `!` icon to distinguish from the stem.
- Student-runner rendering deferred to when the runner is built.

**Cloze authoring**
- **Item-ID prefix** `NCLEX_CLZ_`; bounds 2–6 blanks × 2–5 choices ×
  exactly 1 correct per blank.
- **Stem holds the sentence** with inline `{N}` markers. Blank IDs
  `b1`, `b2`, … are stable across reorders; choice IDs `c1`, `c2`, …
  restart per blank. Nested `correct.feedback[bid][cid]` avoids the
  collision that a flat map would produce.
- **Click-to-insert** — `+ Add blank` finds the lowest free `N` in
  1–6, inserts `{N}` at the cursor (with a leading space if needed),
  and reuses an existing orphan card with that ID if one exists.
- **Orphan preservation** — removing a marker from the stem greys out
  the matching card with a "will be dropped on save" badge; retyping
  the marker reconnects it. Orphans auto-drop at save time.
- **Silent renumber** — gaps like `{1} {3}` are rewritten to
  `{1} {2}` by the parser, with blank IDs remapped in lockstep across
  stem / `content.blanks` / `correct.answers` / `correct.feedback`.
  Two-phase placeholder substitution prevents the mid-rewrite
  collision (`{3} → {2}` mustn't then rewrite an existing `{2}`).
- **Stem-to-editor sync via `document.getElementById('bank-stem')`** —
  deliberately dirty. Lifting the stem into shared shell state would
  mean restructuring the shell for one editor's edge case. Scoped to
  the mounted-Cloze case; documented in a code comment.
- **Default scaffold** — 2 blank cards × 2 empty choices. On an empty
  stem both flip to orphan on mount; the first two `+ Add blank`
  clicks reuse them by ID rather than stacking.

**Parser design drift from handoff**
- Handoff sketch used `throw` for validation errors; I matched the
  existing `{ ok, ... } | { ok: false, error }` pattern used by
  bowtie.ts / matrix.ts so the dispatcher doesn't need a try/catch
  branch for one type.
- Handoff suggested passing `stem` through the top-level dispatcher
  params; I kept it scoped to `cloze: { stem, blanks }` so Family A
  call sites stay unchanged. Return type gains `stem?: string` on the
  success branch — only CLOZE populates it, others leave it undefined.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/cloze.ts` — marker extraction, gap
  renumber, orphan drop, per-blank validation.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/cloze-editor.tsx` — three-section UI
  (toolbar + live preview + per-blank cards), stem DOM listener,
  per-choice radio/text/feedback, hidden-input serialisers.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — CLOZE added to
  `QUESTION_TYPES` + `ITEM_ID_PREFIX`; `CLOZE_MIN_BLANKS` /
  `CLOZE_MAX_BLANKS` / `CLOZE_MIN_CHOICES` / `CLOZE_MAX_CHOICES`
  constants.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/types.ts` — `ClozeChoice` / `ClozeBlank` /
  `ClozeContent` / `ClozeCorrect`; union extensions in
  `BankItemContent` + `BankItemCorrect`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/form-shape.ts` — `instruction: string` (Part A)
  + `cloze_blanks` array (Part B); defaults in `emptyInitial()`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/index.ts` — `ClozeBlankInput` import,
  `cloze` key on `params`, CLOZE branch, `stem?` on `ParseResult`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts` — `'CLOZE'` added to
  `VALID_TYPES` (the known drift point — flagged in the handoff and
  caught on first read); `instruction` extracted and persisted as
  `NULL` when blank; CLOZE FormData extraction block (orphan-filtered
  early); `finalStem = parsed.stem ?? stem` so CLOZE's renumbered
  stem overwrites the curator input.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — instruction
  textarea block above the stem, stem textarea renamed to
  `id="bank-stem"` (the Cloze editor reads from this), `ClozeEditor`
  import + CLOZE case in `renderEditor()`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — `instruction: string |
  null` on `FullBankRow`; `instruction: row.instruction ?? ''` +
  `cloze_blanks` branch in `rowToInitial()`; `cloze_blanks` included
  in the returned `BankFormInitial`.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — `bank-instruction-*` block (amber
  card) + `bank-cz-*` block (toolbar, preview, per-blank cards,
  choice rows, orphan state) appended; Family A + Matrix + Bow-tie
  CSS untouched.
- `mynclex/db/seed-bank-dev.sql` — one CLOZE seed row
  (`NCLEX_CLZ_00001`, "Heart Failure presentation"). Prior row 10's
  closing `;` became `,`.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — Cloze `content` and
  `correct` examples rewritten to the new stem-plus-markers +
  nested-feedback shape; paragraph explaining blank-ID stability,
  per-blank choice-ID restart, and silent renumber.

### Migrations applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_bank_cloze_seed_slice_1_8` — single INSERT. Returned
  `{"success":true}`. Verified via `SELECT ... jsonb_array_length` —
  3 blanks on the row, stem has 3 markers.

### Drift caught during execution

- **ESLint `react-hooks/immutability`** — first pass used
  `MARKER_RE.lastIndex = 0` + `exec` inside `ClozePreview` (a React
  component), which mutates a module-level value. Fixed by switching
  to `stemText.matchAll(MARKER_RE)`, which is iterator-based and
  doesn't touch `lastIndex`. The module-level helper
  `parseStemMarkers()` still uses `exec` (fine — it's not a
  component).

### Verified

- Migration applied successfully to dev Supabase; seed row queries
  clean.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npx eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` — clean.
- `npm run build` (webpack) — clean. Every route still compiles:
  `/`, `/admin`, `/admin/bank`, `/admin/payments`, `/login`,
  `/logout`, `/no-access`, `/pick-role`, `/register`, `/router`,
  `/student`, `/tutor` + proxy middleware.

### Not yet verified (Sam's session, on dev Worker)

Per the handoff, in-browser verification is deferred to the next
session as its own 5-phase pass:

1. Instruction round-trip (open a Matrix row, add instruction, save,
   reopen).
2. Cloze create — 3 blanks, 3 choices each, happy path → saves with
   `NCLEX_CLZ_00002`.
3. Cloze edit — reopen `NCLEX_CLZ_00001`, verify all 3 blanks
   pre-fill with correct picks + feedback.
4. Gap renumber — edit `NCLEX_CLZ_00001`, delete `{2}`, orphan card
   appears; save; reopen — stem is now `{1} {2}` clean and cards
   rebind to `b1` / `b2`.
5. Rejection cases — blank missing correct pick, <2 blanks, <2
   choices.

### Deferred to future sessions / out of scope here

- **CLONING.md update** — file still doesn't exist; same deferral as
  Slices 1.5 / 1.6 / 1.7.
- **Highlight, Drag-drop** — each as its own slice.
- **Student runner** — now unblocked for all 7 authored types (MCQ,
  TF, SATA, SELECT_N, MATRIX, BOWTIE, CLOZE) after Highlight and
  Drag-drop land.
- **Tutor-private CLOZE authoring** — same editor against
  `nclex_tutor_questions` once tutor workflows arrive.
- **Lift stem into shared shell state** — the `getElementById`
  approach is scoped to CLOZE and works, but if the editor grows or
  a second type needs stem access we should refactor. Flagged.

### Next session

Options:
- (a) Highlight (Slice 1.9) — passage with selectable chunks.
- (b) Drag-drop — ordered slot filling; most interactive type.
- (c) Student runner — start consuming the 7 live types end-to-end.

Per the handoff's trajectory, Highlight is the natural next — it
finishes Family B before the runner.

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Slice 1.7 — add `instruction` column)

Tiny preventive schema change. Adds a nullable `instruction TEXT` column
to both `nclex_bank_items` and `nclex_tutor_questions`. No editor
changes; the column sits unused until a future slice wires it in.

### Decisions (prior-session context)

- **Instruction is conceptually distinct from stem.** Stem holds the
  scenario and overall prompt; instruction holds the task directive
  ("Which action should the nurse take FIRST?", "Complete the bow-tie",
  "Select all that apply"). On the real NCLEX, these are often
  separable, and splitting them later enables better case-study UX,
  better search/filtering, and possible future localisation.
- **Add now, wire later.** Real content volume is near zero (only
  dev seeds), so the migration cost is trivial right now and grows
  with content volume later.
- **Both tables get the column.** Parallel ownership model convention
  — tutor-private table stays structurally identical to QAcademy-owned.
- **Nullable, no backfill.** Existing seeds have NULL for `instruction`.
  Future editor slice will let curators populate it for new questions.

### Files modified
- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — added `instruction TEXT` in both
  `nclex_bank_items` and `nclex_tutor_questions` (placed right before
  `created_at` in each block, matching the Postgres column order after
  `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`).
- `mynclex/SESSIONS.md` — this entry.

### Migrations applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)
- `mynclex_bank_add_instruction_column_slice_1_7` — two `ALTER TABLE
  … ADD COLUMN instruction TEXT` + two `COMMENT ON COLUMN`. Applied
  via Supabase MCP; returned `{"success":true}`. Verified present via
  `information_schema.columns` (both `text`, `is_nullable=YES`).

### Files unchanged (explicitly)
- Every TS file in `lib/bank/` and `app/(app)/admin/bank/` — we
  deliberately did NOT surface the column to the editor in this slice.
  That's a future slice.
- `db/rls.sql` — column inherits existing policies; no changes needed.

### Verified
- Migration applied successfully to dev Supabase.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean (no output).
- `npx eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` — clean (no output).
- `npm run build` (webpack) — clean. Every route still compiles.
- Editor code is untouched and uses column-explicit SELECTs, so
  `/admin/bank` is invisibly unchanged. Browser re-check of an existing
  MCQ / Matrix / Bow-tie row deferred to Sam's next dev-Worker session.

### Deferred to future sessions
- **Wiring `instruction` into the editor shell** — add a textarea above
  the stem in `editor-shell.tsx`, add `instruction: string` to
  `BankFormInitial`, read it in `parseFormData()`, map it in
  `rowToInitial()`. Small slice when we're ready.
- **Backfilling existing seeds** — if we want existing seeds to use
  `instruction` meaningfully, manually split each stem. Also a future
  slice.
- **Student-runner rendering** — decide whether instruction appears
  above or below the stem. Punted to when the runner is built.

### Next session

Return to **Slice 1.8: Cloze authoring**. Planning mostly complete in
the prior session log — decisions on click-based add/remove, unified
stem with `{N}` pills, content shape, and bounds are all settled.
Remaining design questions to confirm before build:
1. Bounds: 2–6 blanks per question, 2–5 choices per blank, exactly 1
   correct per blank
2. Blank ID convention: `b1`, `b2`, `b3` stable IDs
3. Live preview behaviour when a blank has no correct pick yet
4. Whether the same `{N}` can appear twice in the sentence (Claude Web
   recommended no)

---

## Session — 2026-04-22 (Bank Slice 1.6 — Bow-tie authoring)

Second Family B question type live. End-to-end create / edit / delete
for BOWTIE. Introduced the tabbed-wing switcher pattern with live
answer-key preview — the first use of tabs anywhere in `/admin/bank`.
Plan drafted in Claude Web; executed from a pre-written handoff file.

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam, via Claude Web)

- **Strict NCLEX correctness** — exactly 2 Left + 1 Centre + 2 Right.
  No "any of these would count" flexibility in this slice.
- **Three self-contained wings** — rejected the global token pool
  approach mid-design; each wing owns its label, tokens, and
  correctness independently. Matches how NCSBN writes bow-ties.
- **Curator-defined wing labels** — preset dropdown per wing +
  typeable custom. Text field is source of truth; dropdown fills
  the field but doesn't lock it. Supports both standard bow-ties
  ("Actions / Condition / Parameters") and NCSBN variants
  ("Evidence / Problem / Actions").
- **Tabbed editing with live preview** — only one wing visible at
  a time to keep form focused. Top-of-panel preview + status dots
  on tabs keep the whole picture in view while zoomed in.
- **Coloured tab + wing pairing** — green Left, amber Centre, red
  Right. Matches NGN primer visual conventions and makes the three
  wings instantly distinguishable.
- **Token ID prefixes lt / ct / rt** — wing-local uniqueness via
  prefix is sufficient; feedback map is flat and keyed by token ID
  across the whole question.
- **Soft-cap UX for the 3rd checkbox** in Left/Right wings: ticking a
  3rd auto-unticks the oldest picked. Avoids a confirmation modal
  while still enforcing "exactly 2 correct."

### Drift caught and fixed during execution

- **`VALID_TYPES` in `actions.ts`** — the handoff flagged this
  specifically (lesson from Slice 1.5's drift). Added `'BOWTIE'`; no
  surprise drift beyond the flagged surface.
- **`HiddenSerialisers` wrapper swap** — the handoff wrapped each
  token's hidden inputs in a `<span>`. Switched to `<Fragment
  key=...>` to match the pattern Slice 1.5's Matrix editor uses —
  same React key semantics, no stray inline elements in the DOM,
  still works the same inside a `<form>`.
- **`BowtiePreview` `chip`/`emptyChip`** — the handoff called these
  as plain functions without passing keys. Harmless visually but
  React would have warned about missing keys in the sibling list.
  Added explicit `key` props (`'l0'`, `'l1'`, `'c0'`, `'r0'`, `'r1'`)
  at the call sites — same output, no warning.
- **Removed unused `validity` prop on `WingPanel`** — the handoff
  defined it but the component only reads `correctCount`. ESLint
  `no-unused-vars` would have caught it; dropped to keep the file
  clean.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/bowtie.ts` — strict NCLEX parser.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/bowtie-editor.tsx` — three-wing tabbed UI
  with live preview + status dots + hidden FormData serialisers.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — BOWTIE in QUESTION_TYPES +
  ITEM_ID_PREFIX (`NCLEX_BT_`); BT_*_CORRECT + BT_WING_MAX_TOKENS
  constants; BT_{LEFT,CENTRE,RIGHT}_PRESETS label lists.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/types.ts` — BowtieToken / BowtieWing /
  BowtieContent / BowtieCorrect + union extensions.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/form-shape.ts` — 6 new `bowtie_*` fields on
  `BankFormInitial` (one label + one token list per wing);
  `emptyInitial()` defaults: preset labels + 3/2/3 empty tokens.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/index.ts` — import + `bowtie?` in params
  + BOWTIE branch in `parseByType`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts` — `'BOWTIE'` added to
  VALID_TYPES; per-wing FormData extraction (label + parallel id /
  text / feedback / correct arrays); payload passed to dispatcher.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — BowtieEditor
  import + BOWTIE case in `renderEditor()`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — `rowToInitial` BOWTIE
  branch; 6 new `bowtie_*` fields on the returned `BankFormInitial`.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — `.bt-*` block appended (preview
  grid, tab bar with coloured active-tab borders, wing cards,
  counter pills, token rows). Family A + Matrix styles untouched.
- `mynclex/db/seed-bank-dev.sql` — one Bow-tie seed row
  (`NCLEX_BT_00001`, "Inferior wall MI"). Prior row 9's closing `;`
  became `,`.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — `content` example gains the
  three-wing shape with `label` + `tokens`; `correct` example swaps
  the old condition/actions/parameters shape for
  `left`/`centre`/`right` + flat feedback map; paragraph explaining
  wing-scoped correctness and the lt/ct/rt prefix convention.

### Migrations applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_bank_bowtie_seed_slice_1_6` — the single INSERT. Applied
  via Supabase MCP; returned `{"success":true}`.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean (no output).
- `npx eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` — clean (no output).
- `npm run build` (webpack) — clean. Every route still compiles:
  `/`, `/admin`, `/admin/bank`, `/admin/payments`, `/login`,
  `/logout`, `/no-access`, `/pick-role`, `/register`, `/router`,
  `/student`, `/tutor` + proxy middleware.

### Not yet verified (Sam's session, on dev Worker)

- Create flow end-to-end as `+mynclexsuperadmin` and `+mynclexadmin`.
- Tab switching preserves state across left/centre/right.
- Label-picker preset → tab text + preview column header updates.
- Ticking / unticking correct tokens updates preview chips live.
- Soft-cap: ticking a 3rd checkbox auto-unticks the oldest.
- Counter pill colour transitions (warn / ok / err).
- Edit flow — reopen a saved Bow-tie row; all three wings pre-fill
  including labels, tokens, ticks, feedback.
- Rejection cases via tampered submit: blank wing label; wrong
  correct count; empty wing.

### Deferred to future sessions / out of scope here

- **CLONING.md update** — file still doesn't exist. Same deferral as
  Slice 1.5.
- **Cloze, Highlight, Drag-drop** — each as its own slice.
- **Student runner** — consumes all per-type editors in display mode;
  unblocks preview for every authored type.
- **Tutor-private BOWTIE authoring** — same editor against
  `nclex_tutor_questions` once tutor workflows arrive.
- **Tab keyboard navigation (arrow-key)** — today tabs are reachable
  via click and Tab focus but arrow-key tab-list semantics aren't
  wired. Accessible enough for v1; revisit if curators ask.
- **Token drag-to-reorder within a wing** — not needed for v1; string
  IDs keep it safe whenever it's added.
- **Pre-existing `.bank-grid-2` / `.bank-grid-3` / `.bank-link-btn`
  gaps from Slice 1.4** — still open; not introduced here.

### Next session

Options:
- (a) Cloze (Slice 1.7) — sentence with inline dropdown blanks.
  Bounded, template-parse pattern.
- (b) Highlight — passage with selectable chunks.
- (c) Drag-drop — ordered slot filling. Most interactive.
- (d) Student runner — start consuming the 6 live types end-to-end.

Per handoff's recommendation: finish Family B before the runner.
Cloze is the natural next.

## Session — 2026-04-21 (Bank Slice 1.5 — Matrix authoring)

First Family B question type live. End-to-end create / edit / delete
for MATRIX, using the Slice 1.3 shell + per-type editor architecture.
Plan drafted end-to-end in Claude Web; executed from a pre-written
handoff file.

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam, via Claude Web)

- **String IDs for cell_map keys** — `r1 → c1` rather than positional
  indices. Reorder-safe and shuffle-safe. Matches Family A option IDs.
- **parseByType dispatcher extended** with a `matrix` branch; parsers
  stay pure (no FormData reading inside parsers). Symmetric with
  Family A's flat-array params.
- **Per-row feedback ships in this slice.** Matches Family A; matches
  bank.md spec.
- **Editable row-axis label** at the top-left of the grid — stored in
  `content.row_label`. Lets curators use "Finding", "Medication",
  "Screening test", or whatever fits the question.
- **Editor mirrors student view** — curator builds on the same grid
  the student answers on. Same rule will apply to Highlight, Cloze,
  Drag-drop, Bow-tie in future slices.
- **Bounds: 2–6 rows × 2–6 columns.** Default 3×3 on new.

### Drift caught and fixed during execution

- **`VALID_TYPES` in `actions.ts` was a hardcoded
  `Set<QuestionType>(['MCQ','TF','SATA','SELECT_N'])`** — the handoff
  did not flag it. Added `'MATRIX'` to the set; without this every
  Matrix submit would be rejected at the first gate with "Invalid
  question type" regardless of payload.
- **Matrix editor's per-row `<>...</>` fragment inside `.map()`** would
  have triggered a React missing-key warning. Replaced with
  `<Fragment key={row.id}>` — same runtime shape, React happy.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/matrix.ts`
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/matrix-editor.tsx`

### Files modified

- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — MATRIX added to
  QUESTION_TYPES + ITEM_ID_PREFIX; new MIN/MAX/DEFAULT_MATRIX_ROWS/
  COLS constants; Family A header comment refreshed.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/types.ts` — MatrixRow, MatrixColumn,
  MatrixContent, MatrixCorrect + union extensions.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/form-shape.ts` — matrix_row_label, matrix_rows,
  matrix_columns, matrix_correct on BankFormInitial; defaults in
  emptyInitial() (3 rows × 3 columns, empty strings).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/index.ts` — import + MatrixParseInput in
  params + MATRIX branch in parseByType.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts` — VALID_TYPES drift fix;
  Matrix FormData extraction; parseByType call passes matrix payload.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — MatrixEditor
  import; MATRIX case in renderEditor().
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — rowToInitial's Matrix
  branch reads content.row_label / rows / columns and correct.cells /
  feedback; four new fields on the returned BankFormInitial.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — appended `.bank-matrix-*` block
  (wrap, table, corner, col-head, row-head, cell, bounds, feedback
  row). Family A styles untouched.
- `mynclex/db/seed-bank-dev.sql` — one Matrix seed row
  (`NCLEX_MAT_00001`, "Finding triage"). Prior row 8's closing `;`
  became `,`; new row closes the INSERT.
- `mynclex/docs/product-plan/bank.md` — Matrix `content` example
  gained `row_label`; `correct` example replaced numeric indices with
  string IDs; added paragraph explaining the ID choice.

### Migrations applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_bank_matrix_seed_slice_1_5` — the single INSERT. Applied
  via Supabase MCP; returned `{"success":true}`.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean (no output).
- `npx eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` — clean (no output).
- `npm run build` (webpack) — clean. Every route still compiles:
  `/`, `/admin`, `/admin/bank`, `/admin/payments`, `/login`,
  `/logout`, `/no-access`, `/pick-role`, `/register`, `/router`,
  `/student`, `/tutor` + proxy middleware.

### Not yet verified (Sam's session, on dev Worker)

- Create flow for MATRIX end-to-end as `+mynclexsuperadmin` and
  `+mynclexadmin` (BANK_CURATE granted).
- Edit flow — reopen a saved Matrix row; confirm row_label, rows,
  columns, radio picks, feedback all pre-fill.
- Delete flow — confirm removes from listing.
- Rejection cases via tampered submit: blank row_label; row with no
  correct pick; submit with fewer than `MIN_MATRIX_ROWS` rows.
- Type-switching in create mode: MCQ → MATRIX → MCQ preserves
  non-editor fields.
- Type dropdown disabled in edit mode.

### Deferred to future sessions / out of scope here

- **CLONING.md update** — the handoff asked for this, but the file
  doesn't exist yet (listed as "future" in `mynclex/CLAUDE.md`). Skip
  now; fold Matrix note in when CLONING.md is created.
- **Highlight, Cloze, Drag-drop, Bow-tie** — each as its own slice.
- **Student runner** — needed before Matrix can be previewed in-form.
- **Tutor-private Matrix authoring** — same editor against
  `nclex_tutor_questions`; comes with tutor-side workflows.
- **Shuffle labelling** — the "Shuffle options" checkbox is labelled
  Family A-centric; for Matrix it would shuffle rows and columns.
  Revisit when the student runner lands.
- **Pre-existing `.bank-grid-2` / `.bank-grid-3` / `.bank-link-btn`
  class gaps noted in Slice 1.4** — still open; not introduced here.

### Next session

Options:
- (a) Family B — next type. Bow-tie is the most NGN-signature (fixed
  5-slot). Cloze and Highlight both require a richer text-input UI.
- (b) Student runner — consume the same per-type split for display.
  Unblocks preview mode for all authored types.
- (c) RLS on the remaining 6 bank tables (tutor questions, case
  studies, readiness packs).

## Session — 2026-04-21 (Bank Slice 1.4 — filters + two-pane focus mode)

Restructured the /admin/bank page into two distinct modes
driven entirely by URL state. Eliminates the old split-panel
layout that crowded both the list and the form.

### Why

With only Family A live and 8 seed rows the split-panel was
already cramped. Once Family B lands (5 more types) and real
content arrives, the list becomes unusable without filters,
and the form becomes unusable at its current width. Fixing
both before Family B means every new editor drops into a
page that's already ready for it.

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam)

- **Two-pane focus mode, not drawer/modal.** When editing,
  the list collapses to a compact left-hand navigator; the
  form takes the rest. Curators edit questions back-to-back
  without popping in and out of a modal — Gmail-inbox /
  Notion-database / Linear-issue pattern.
- **URL drives everything.** No client state, no mode flag.
  Bare `/admin/bank` = browse. `?edit=ID` or `?new=1` =
  focus. Filter params live alongside. Bookmarkable,
  shareable, back-button-safe.
- **5 filters in scope:** type, client-needs category,
  difficulty, status, free-text search. Remaining axes
  (subcat, subject, body system, topic, subtopic, bloom,
  tags) deferred — when curators hit the limit we add more.
  Start lean, scale on need.
- **Native `<details>`/`<summary>` accordions** for the
  three form sections (Content open by default;
  Classification + Housekeeping collapsed). Zero JS, fully
  accessible, keyboard-navigable.
- **Sticky Save bar at the TOP of the form**, not bottom.
  Long forms + bottom buttons = scroll-fatigue. Sticking to
  top keeps the action available regardless of scroll
  position.
- **Filters persist through focus mode via URL.** If user
  narrows to "all hard SATA" then edits one, the left
  navigator only shows hard SATA. Preserves their context.
- **Browse-mode rows show `[Edit]` only, no `[Delete]`.**
  Mockup hinted at row-level delete, but verification only
  covers delete in focus mode — and keeping destructive
  actions behind the focus view (where the curator sees
  the full question) reduces accidental bulk deletion.
  Saves a client-component file too. Can add later if
  curators ask.
- **Preview deferred** — reuses the student runner in a
  preview mode when the runner exists. Building a bespoke
  preview now would be duplicated work.

### Files created

- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/filters.tsx` — filter bar
  component. 5 controls, GET-form submission.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/navigator.tsx` — compact
  left-pane list for focus mode.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — split into
  browse-mode and focus-mode render branches; applies
  filters to the Supabase query (`.eq` for type/category/
  difficulty/status, `.ilike` for search); loads the full
  row for edit mode; builds `preservedFilterQuery` so
  navigation between modes keeps filter context.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — wrapped
  Content / Classification / Housekeeping sections in
  collapsible `<details>`; moved Save/Delete/Cancel to a
  sticky top bar; added optional `cancelHref` prop so
  Cancel lands back on the filtered browse view. `form.tsx`
  remains a thin re-export; `cancelHref` defaults to
  `/admin/bank` so the old signature still works.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — added `.bank-browse-*`,
  `.bank-filters*`, `.bank-row-*`, `.bank-focus-*`,
  `.bank-nav-*`, `.bank-section-*`, `.bank-form-topbar*`,
  `.bank-btn-sm` classes. Removed dead `.bank-split`,
  `.bank-list-*`, `.bank-form-title`, `.bank-form-cancel*`,
  and the old `position: sticky` on `.bank-form`.

### Files unchanged

- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/form.tsx` (thin re-export).
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/*`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/*`.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/{types,classifications,form-shape}.ts`.
- DB schema, RLS, seeds.

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` clean.
- `npm run build` clean — every route still compiles,
  including /admin/bank.
- No references to retired `.bank-split` / `.bank-list-*`
  classes outside the CSS file itself (or the historical
  entry for them in this log).
- Slice 1.3's hidden `item_id` input still rendered by the
  shell in edit mode; Save-changes flow intact.

### Notes / pre-existing gaps (out of scope)

- Several class names referenced by editors/shell have no
  matching CSS rules: `.bank-grid-2`, `.bank-grid-3`,
  `.bank-link-btn`, `.bank-row-remove`, `.bank-input--sm`,
  `.bank-input--num`, `.bank-option-fields`, `.bank-checks`,
  `.bank-check`. These gaps existed before this slice —
  the form renders with default stacked flex fallbacks —
  and were not introduced by Slice 1.4. Worth a follow-up
  tidy once curators feel the form's visual rhythm is off.
- `.bank-table-*` / `.bank-cell-*` classes from an even
  earlier listing layout remain in the CSS but are
  unreferenced. Out of this slice's scope to delete.

### Next session — **Bank Slice 1.5: Family B authoring (Matrix first)**

Family B is the set of NGN-style question types that don't
fit the Family A "option list + correct toggle" mould:

| Type        | Shape                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `MATRIX`    | rows × columns grid, each row picks one column     |
| `HIGHLIGHT` | select tokens (words/phrases) inside a passage     |
| `CLOZE`     | passage with inline blanks, each a dropdown        |
| `DRAG_DROP` | drag tokens into ordered slots                     |
| `BOWTIE`    | signature NGN layout — causes / actions / problems |

**Slice 1.5 scope = Matrix only.** Single type, end-to-end.
Most-bounded Family B shape, so it's the right candidate to
prove the Slice 1.3 architecture (shell + per-type editor +
per-type parser) scales through an editor with a
fundamentally different UI than Family A. Other Family B
types come in their own slices (1.6, 1.7, …).

#### Work items for Slice 1.5

1. **JSON shape decision (align with Sam before coding).**
   Proposed:
   - `content`: `{ rows: [{ id, text }], columns: [{ id, text }] }`
   - `correct`: `{ cell_map: { [rowId]: columnId }, feedback?: { [rowId]: string } }`
   - Bounded 2–6 rows × 2–6 columns to start.
2. **Extend classifications.ts** — add `MATRIX` to
   `QUESTION_TYPES` + `ITEM_ID_PREFIX` (`NCLEX_MAT_`).
3. **Extend types.ts** — add `MatrixContent` /
   `MatrixCorrect` interfaces and union them into
   `BankItemContent` / `BankItemCorrect`.
4. **Extend form-shape.ts** — decide whether Matrix lives
   alongside Family A fields on `BankFormInitial` (adds
   `rows`, `columns`, `cell_map`) or if Family B gets a
   disjoint initial type. Probably additive fields with
   sensible empty defaults — keeps `rowToInitial` simple.
5. **Create `lib/bank/parsers/matrix.ts`** — validates
   row/column bounds, every row has exactly one correct
   column, all referenced column IDs exist.
6. **Update `parseByType` dispatcher** — route `MATRIX` to
   the new parser.
7. **Create `lib/bank/editors/matrix-editor.tsx`** — grid
   UI: rows × columns, one radio per cell grouped by
   `name="matrix_correct_${rowId}"`. Add/remove row + add/
   remove column controls. Hidden inputs for row IDs +
   texts, column IDs + texts, so the FormData carries the
   whole shape without any manual marshalling (same
   pattern as Family A editors).
8. **Wire `renderEditor()` in `editor-shell.tsx`** to the
   new `MatrixEditor`.
9. **Update `rowToInitial` in `page.tsx`** to map the
   Matrix JSONB back into `BankFormInitial` fields.
10. **Add a Matrix seed row** so the list/focus view has
    something to render. Stays in the dev Supabase project.

#### Known risks / watch-outs

- Matrix FormData shape uses per-row correct IDs — the
  dispatcher's current `correctIds: string[]` doesn't fit.
  `parseByType` may need to accept a `matrix` branch with
  its own param shape, or the parser pulls directly from
  FormData. Settle this before coding the editor.
- Several pre-existing unstyled class names noted in the
  1.4 entry (`bank-grid-2`, `bank-grid-3`, etc.) will
  become more visible once Matrix adds grid UI of its own.
  Consider fixing in a side slice, not mid-Family-B.
- Student-view preview for Matrix still deferred — will
  come with the student runner.

#### Out of scope for 1.5

- Other Family B types (Highlight, Cloze, Drag-drop,
  Bow-tie) — each gets its own slice.
- Tutor-side authoring (reuses same editors against
  `nclex_tutor_questions` — separate slice).
- Student runner (separate track).

## Session — 2026-04-21 (Bank Slice 1.3 — editor architecture refactor)

Restructured the Family A authoring form from one monolithic
client component into a shell + per-type editor pattern.
Zero UI changes; zero behaviour changes beyond a pre-existing
edit-save bug fix (see below).

### Why now

Family B (Matrix, Highlight, Cloze, Drag-drop, Bow-tie) are
structurally different UIs, not just variations of an option
list. Adding them to the existing `if (type === 'X')` branches
in a single `form.tsx` would produce a 1500-line tangle.
Refactoring while Family A is still the only thing live keeps
the diff small and reviewable. The new shape also sets up
reuse for (a) tutor-side authoring (parallel ownership model
in bank.md — same UI points at `nclex_tutor_questions`), and
(b) the future student-side question runner (same per-type
component split, display-only).

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam)

- **Shell + per-type editor, not type-branches.** Shell owns
  the ~80% shared (stem, rationale, classification axes,
  housekeeping, actions). Editors own the ~20% unique per
  type. `form.tsx` becomes a thin re-export dispatcher.
- **Editors live in `lib/bank/editors/`, not route-local.**
  Same reason as `lib/bank/types.ts` — tutors will need
  these. `lib/bank/` is the bank's shared machinery.
- **Parsers extracted per-type too.** `lib/bank/parsers/` with
  one file per type + a dispatcher index. `actions.ts` calls
  `parseByType(question_type, payload)`. Same pattern as the
  editors — Family B parsers will be bespoke per type.
- **`types.ts` stays Family A only.** Each future type
  extends the discriminated union in its own slice, when
  the shape is actually settled. No speculative types.
- **Name-based form fields instead of manual FormData
  appendage.** Editors render inputs with `name=` attrs so
  their values flow directly into the outer FormData. The
  shell's onSubmit no longer marshals editor state — there's
  no editor state to marshal from its perspective. Server
  payload is byte-identical to Slice 1.2.
- **Sam authorised one bug fix alongside the refactor
  (Option B).** Slice 1.2's `form.tsx` never posted
  `item_id`, so Save-changes on an existing row would have
  returned "Missing item_id." The new shell renders a hidden
  `<input name="item_id">` in edit mode. One-line fix; the
  refactor's verification checklist ("Edit saves updates")
  wouldn't have passed without it.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/mcq.ts` — MCQ content/correct builder.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/tf.ts`
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/sata.ts`
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/select-n.ts`
- `mynclex/lib/bank/parsers/index.ts` — `parseByType()` dispatcher.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/mcq-editor.tsx` — option list + radio.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/tf-editor.tsx` — locked True/False.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/sata-editor.tsx` — option list + checkboxes.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/editors/select-n-editor.tsx` — option list + count field.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/editor-shell.tsx` — shared frame.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/form.tsx` — now a ~15-line
  re-export that wraps `EditorShell` (page.tsx still imports
  `BankForm` from the same path).
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts` — internal
  `parseFormData()` now delegates the type-specific branches
  to `parseByType()`. Auth gate, `nextItemId()`, DB write,
  `revalidatePath`, `redirect` — all unchanged.

### Files unchanged

- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx`
- `mynclex/lib/bank/types.ts`
- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts`
- `mynclex/lib/bank/form-shape.ts`
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` and every other CSS file.
- DB schema, RLS, seeds.

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` clean.
- `npm run build` clean — every route still compiles.
- `CLIENT_NEEDS_CATEGORIES` referenced only in
  `editor-shell.tsx` (UI) + `classifications.ts` (source) +
  `actions.ts` (server validation). Not duplicated across
  editors — the shell owns classification dropdowns once.
- `MIN_OPTIONS` / `MAX_OPTIONS` appear in each of the 3
  add/remove-capable editors + the 3 add/remove-bound
  parsers. This is by design: editors gate the Add/Remove
  buttons, parsers enforce server-side bounds. Neither is
  a classification dropdown.
- Server/client directives correct on every file: parsers
  have none (server-safe), editors all `'use client'`,
  shell + form `'use client'`, actions `'use server'`,
  page has no directive (server component).

### Next session
- **Bank Slice 1.4 — Family B, first type.** Matrix is the
  most bounded of Family B (grid of rows × columns, each cell
  a radio). Good candidate to prove the new architecture
  scales. Alternatives: Bow-tie (signature NGN but fixed 5-
  slot shape), student runner (reverse direction — consume
  the same per-type split for display).

---

## Session — 2026-04-21 (UI Slice 1 — light theme migration)

Moved MyNclex off the dark landing-page palette for every
authenticated and auth page. Landing page untouched.

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam)

- **Landing stays dark; everything else goes light.** Long-dwell
  product pages (bank, future rationales, programme content) need
  to read like documents, not marketing.
- **Copy the QAcademy palette from MyTeacher/Licensure exactly.**
  Same navy `#1e3a5f`, teal `#2d7d72`, `#f9fafb` bg, white cards.
  Three-product consistency beats a bespoke MyNclex theme.
- **System font stack** (`-apple-system, ...`) instead of Inter —
  matches siblings. Inter removed from body font chain.
- **Same class names everywhere.** No component code changes; only
  CSS files and import lines edited. `landing.css` keeps its dark
  palette scoped to itself.
- **Kept `.shell-dropdown-item-current`** in the new light
  shell.css (teal text on `--primary-light`, no hover change) so
  the role-switcher dropdown still marks the active workspace.
  Dropping it would have been a silent UX regression.

### Files created
- `mynclex/app/tokens.css` — QAcademy light palette + shared
  primitives (`.btn-*`, `.form-group`, `.alert-*`).
- `mynclex/app/auth.css` — light auth-card styling for /login
  and /register. Replaces `app/register/auth.css`.

### Files rewritten
- `mynclex/app/shell.css` — white topbar, navy brand, teal chip.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — light dashboards, section-cards,
  pick-role, no-access, `/admin/bank` split-panel + table + form.

### Files modified (import swaps only)
- `mynclex/app/login/page.tsx`
- `mynclex/app/register/page.tsx`
- `mynclex/app/pick-role/page.tsx`
- `mynclex/app/no-access/page.tsx`
- `mynclex/app/(app)/layout.tsx`

### Files deleted
- `mynclex/app/register/auth.css` (moved to `app/auth.css`).

### Untouched
- `mynclex/app/page.tsx` — landing.
- `mynclex/app/landing.css` — landing palette + visuals.
- Every component file (topbar, role-chip, user-menu, footer,
  bank form, admin page, etc.).
- Middleware, Supabase clients, Server Actions, DB schema, RLS.

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `eslint app components` clean.
- No stray dark-palette `rgba(232, 238, 245, ...)` or
  `rgba(9, 21, 36, ...)` values outside `app/landing.css`.
- Only `app/page.tsx` still imports `landing.css`.

### Next session
- Return to bank work — Family B authoring (Matrix first is
  most-bounded; Bow-tie is highest-profile NGN), RLS on the
  remaining 6 bank tables, or student-side practice runner.

---

## Session — 2026-04-21 (Bank Slice 1.2 — MCQ/TF/SATA/Select N authoring)

First real curator workflow on top of Slice 1's read-only listing.
Create + edit + delete for the four "Family A" question types:
MCQ, TF, SATA, SELECT_N. These four share ~80% of the authoring UI
(option list + per-option correct toggle + per-option feedback)
and only differ in the correct-answer control — radio for MCQ/TF,
checkbox for SATA/SELECT_N, plus a count field for SELECT_N.

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam)

- **Bundle CRUD into one slice, not split.** Original lean was
  create-only first, edit/delete as a separate 1.3. Sam pushed back:
  edit reuses ~90% of the create form, and splitting was artificial.
  Single slice for all three ops.
- **Family A only this slice.** Of the 9 v1 question types, four
  share an option-list shape (MCQ/TF/SATA/SELECT_N). The other five
  (Matrix, Highlight, Cloze, Drag-drop, Bow-tie) each need a bespoke
  editor — each lands as its own slice (1.3 → 1.7).
- **Keep every field; nothing dropped.** Sam was firm on this even
  for fields not yet wired (`rationale_img`, `marks`, `is_free_sample`,
  `is_builder_visible`, `shuffle_options`, `question_ref`, `batch_id`,
  `nursing_subject`). Form ships with all of them; image upload
  accepts a pasted URL for now (direct upload deferred until
  Supabase Storage is wired in a later slice).
- **Architecture: beta-b pattern, not MyTeacher.** Server component
  page does data + auth gate; thin `'use client'` form component
  handles option-list state + type-driven control swap; plain
  `<form>` submission to Server Actions. Same shape as auth Slices
  1–2 (`actions.ts` next to `page.tsx`). Reviewed both
  `myteacher/teacher/bank.html` (closest in field set, distant in
  stack) and `qacademy-beta-b/src/app/(exams)/question-bank/`
  (native Next.js + Server Actions); beta-b pattern translated 1:1.
- **Split-panel layout (list left, sticky form right).** Sam's call
  over the originally-proposed "list above, form below" — a long
  list would push the form off-screen. Stacks to one column below
  900px so mobile still works.
- **URL-driven edit mode (`?edit={item_id}`).** No separate
  `/new` or `/edit/:id` route. Click a row → URL gains `?edit=ID`
  → form pre-fills. Click "+ New" → URL clears → blank form.
  Bookmarkable, deep-linkable.
- **Auto sequential item IDs per type.** `NCLEX_MCQ_00009`,
  `NCLEX_TF_00001`, `NCLEX_SATA_00001`, `NCLEX_SELN_00001`.
  Computed in the create action via `MAX(item_id) LIKE prefix + 1`,
  fixed-width zero-padded. Type readable at a glance in the
  listing and in error logs. Matches the existing seed.
- **Question type locked on edit.** Changing type would invalidate
  both the JSONB shape (`content` / `correct`) and the ID prefix.
  Enforced server-side; the dropdown is `disabled` in edit mode.
- **Hard delete, not archive.** No FK references to bank items in
  v1 (case-study and readiness-pack join tables aren't populated),
  so nothing cascades. Revisit if/when they are.
- **Server Actions re-check auth + BANK_CURATE/SUPER_ADMIN
  independently.** Page-level gate is UX polish; the action-level
  gate is the real security boundary — defends against tampered
  hidden inputs and direct action invocation.
- **Classifications hardcoded.** `lib/bank/classifications.ts` —
  TS constants for question types, NCLEX client-needs categories
  + subcategories, nursing subjects, body systems, difficulty,
  Bloom's, option letters, ID prefixes. Promotable to a DB lookup
  table later if non-engineers need to edit values without a
  deploy. Topic / subtopic stay free-text inputs (open-ended in
  real authoring).
- **JSONB shapes typed in `lib/bank/types.ts`.** Discriminated
  union on `question_type` so future types (Family B) just add
  their branch — editor, future renderer, and scoring functions
  all narrow the same way.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/bank/classifications.ts` — hardcoded enums.
- `mynclex/lib/bank/types.ts` — TS shapes for `content` /
  `correct` JSONB (Family A only; Family B added per-slice).
- `mynclex/lib/bank/form-shape.ts` — `BankFormInitial` interface
  + `emptyInitial()` factory. Lives outside the form component
  for the RSC-boundary reason described under "Bug fixed mid-
  session" below.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/actions.ts` — three Server Actions
  (`createBankItemAction`, `updateBankItemAction`,
  `deleteBankItemAction`). Each gates auth + permission, parses
  + validates the form payload into `content` / `correct` JSONB,
  performs the DB write, then `revalidatePath` + `redirect`.
  Auto item-ID computation via `nextItemId()`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/form.tsx` — `'use client'`
  component. Manages: type selector, variable-length option list
  (A–F, min 2, max 6, default 4 / locked 2 for TF), per-row
  correct toggle (radio or checkbox), SELECT_N count field, all
  classification + housekeeping fields. Submits via Server Action.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — split-panel layout;
  reads `?edit={id}` searchParam; loads single row in full when
  editing and maps JSONB back into the form's initial-values
  shape; preserves the existing auth gate + listing query.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — added `bank-split`, `bank-list`,
  `bank-form`, option-row, checkbox group, and button styles.
  Sticky right pane on desktop; stacks below 900px.

### Bug fixed mid-session

After the first push, `/admin/bank` 500'd on the dev Worker:

> Attempted to call emptyInitial() from the server but emptyInitial
> is on the client.

`emptyInitial()` was originally exported from `form.tsx` (which
carries `'use client'`) and called by the server component page.
Next.js blocks any server→client *function call* across the RSC
boundary; only components and props can cross. Type-only imports
work, but runtime helpers don't. Fixed by extracting
`BankFormInitial` + `emptyInitial()` into the new neutral
`lib/bank/form-shape.ts` module (no directive). Both sides import
from there — no boundary crossed. Filed as commit 862a26b.

### Verified locally + on dev Worker

- `tsc --noEmit` clean (mynclex root).
- `eslint app/(app)/admin/bank lib/bank` clean.
- Dev server boots without compile errors locally; the only
  runtime errors in this worktree are the pre-existing missing-
  `.env.local` crash in middleware (no Supabase creds in the
  worktree).
- Sam confirmed `/admin/bank` loads on the dev Worker after the
  fix push (commit 862a26b). Workers Builds auto-deploy picked
  up both pushes within minutes.

### Not yet verified (Sam's session)

- Full create-edit-delete flow end-to-end as both
  `+mynclexsuperadmin` and `+mynclexadmin` (BANK_CURATE granted).
- Type-switching in create mode — TF locking True/False;
  SATA / SELECT_N swapping correct controls; SELECT_N count field
  enforcing exactly N.
- Plain TUTOR / STUDENT direct hit on `/admin/bank` → bounce
  to `/admin`.

### Deferred to future sessions

- **Family B authoring** — each in its own slice (Matrix,
  Highlight, Cloze, Drag-drop, Bow-tie). Each adds a new editor
  branch, a new JSONB shape in `lib/bank/types.ts`, and a new
  scoring function later.
- **Direct image upload** — `rationale_img` accepts a pasted URL
  today. Real Supabase Storage upload + bucket policies land in a
  separate slice that can also wire option-image support.
- **Filter chips + pagination on the listing** — fine at 8 rows
  + a 500-row limit; revisit when the list gets long.
- **Student-view preview** — meaningful only once the student
  quiz runner exists. Reuse the runner in author-preview mode
  rather than building it twice.
- **Tutor-private bank** (`nclex_tutor_questions` and friends) —
  duplicate the same authoring UI with a `tutor_id` filter once
  tutor-side workflows arrive.
- **Soft archive** — current delete is hard. Consider archiving
  if/when bank items are referenced by case studies or readiness
  packs (deferred FK pressure).
- **Toast / status-line feedback polish** — today's feedback is a
  single in-form flash ("Saved ✓") plus inline error banner. A
  page-level toast can wait until other admin sections need one.

### Commits

- `11adceb` — `mynclex: MCQ/TF/SATA/Select N authoring UI — Bank Slice 1.2`
- `862a26b` — `mynclex: fix /admin/bank crash — move shared form shape out of client file`

### Next session

Likely options: (a) Family B authoring — pick one type to do
first (Matrix is the most-bounded; Bow-tie is the highest-
profile NGN signature), (b) RLS on the remaining 6 bank tables,
(c) student-side practice runner so the Bank starts producing
value end-to-end, (d) Supabase Storage wiring so rationale +
option images can be uploaded from the form.

---

## Session — 2026-04-21 (Bank Slice 1 — schema + RLS + seed + admin view)

First build work on The Bank. Scope deliberately narrow: QAcademy-owned
tables only, no tutor-private authoring yet; RLS only on
`nclex_bank_items`; a read-only `/admin/bank` listing page to confirm
RLS and data are wired up end-to-end. No authoring UI, no student
runner yet.

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam)

- **Narrow slice instead of "schema for everything."** All 7 bank
  tables landed in one migration (mechanical copy from `bank.md`), but
  RLS + UI start with `nclex_bank_items` only. Tutor-private tables,
  case studies, and readiness packs are structurally present but RLS-
  disabled; policies come per-table in later slices.
- **Question type scope — MCQ only for Slice 1.** TF is effectively MCQ
  with 2 options; it lands alongside SATA later (SATA forces a second
  scoring function anyway — that's when TF earns its keep).
- **Seed strategy — synthetic placeholders, clearly tagged.** 8 rows
  with `batch_id = 'DEV_SEED_001'` for clean removal. Seed file header
  explicitly flags this as NOT real NCLEX content; real editorial work
  is off-platform per the Content Sourcing decision.
- **QAcademy-owned tables first; tutor-private later.** Tutor tables
  are mechanical duplication once the shape works (same columns plus a
  `tutor_id` FK). Building QAcademy-owned first keeps RLS simpler and
  aligns with the higher-value path (the bank students pay for).
- **Judgment call — added `is_published` to both case-study tables** even
  though `bank.md` only lists it on the two item tables. A case study
  needs a draft/live gate too; without it, cases can't be held back
  mid-authoring. Can drop if Sam wants spec-exact.
- **Judgment call — CHECK constraints on enumerated values**
  (`question_type`, `difficulty`, `cjmm_step`, readiness-pack `status`,
  join-table `position`). Prevents author typos; trivial to ALTER if
  new values arise later.
- **RLS shape for `nclex_bank_items`:**
  - Any authenticated user can SELECT where `is_published = TRUE`.
  - `BANK_CURATE` holders (SUPER_ADMIN bypasses via the helper's
    short-circuit) get full access — read drafts + INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.
  - Entitlement gating (paid bank access for self-study students) is
    deliberately NOT in RLS. Belongs to the app layer once payments ship.
- **`/admin/bank` follows the hide-what-you-can't-access pattern.**
  Section card only appears on `/admin` for users with `BANK_CURATE` (or
  SUPER_ADMIN). The page itself also gates server-side, so direct URL
  navigation without the permission bounces to `/admin`.
- **Read-only for now.** Authoring (create/edit/delete), question
  detail view, filter chips, and pagination are all deferred.

### Files created

- `mynclex/db/seed-bank-dev.sql` — 8 synthetic MCQ rows.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/bank/page.tsx` — read-only listing.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — 7 bank tables appended.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — RLS block for `nclex_bank_items`.
- `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx` — now fetches
  `nclex_admin_permissions`; renders a section-card grid when at least
  one card is visible. First card: Question Bank → `/admin/bank`.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — `.dash-card--wide` variant,
  `.section-grid` / `.section-card` styles, focused `.bank-table` /
  `.bank-badge` block.

### Migrations applied to dev (`zrakjibtxyzoqcdtvpmq`)

- `mynclex_bank_tables` — the 7 tables.
- `mynclex_bank_items_rls` — RLS enable + 2 policies.
- `mynclex_bank_dev_seed` — 8 INSERT rows.

### Verified locally

- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `npx eslint` clean on the admin tree.
- Dev server boots without compile errors.
- Unauthenticated `GET /admin/bank` → redirect to `/login` (auth gate
  intact).

### Not yet verified (requires Sam's session)

- Visual rendering for `+mynclexsuperadmin` — should see all 8 rows.
- Section-card hiding for `+mynclexadmin` (no BANK_CURATE granted).
- Redirect for TUTOR/STUDENT attempting to visit `/admin/bank`.

### Deferred to future sessions

- RLS on the other 6 bank tables (per-table as features land).
- Authoring UI for MCQ (create + edit).
- Question detail view.
- Filter chips + pagination on the admin listing.
- SATA + TF (next question-type wave; adds a second scoring function).
- Tutor-private bank view + authoring.
- `BANK_CURATE` CHECK constraint on `nclex_admin_permissions` (still no
  CHECK per main.md's deferral policy).
- `nclex_question_reports` table (separate, from Content Sourcing).

### Manual step Sam may run (optional)

To exercise the non-SUPER_ADMIN curator path on dev:

```sql
INSERT INTO nclex_admin_permissions (user_id, permission)
SELECT id, 'BANK_CURATE' FROM nclex_users
WHERE email = 'mybackpacc+mynclexadmin@gmail.com'
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

Or leave it ungranted to test the hide-the-card path for plain ADMIN.

### Next session

Likely options: (a) MCQ authoring UI (create/edit), (b) RLS on the
remaining 6 bank tables, (c) student-side practice runner. Sam's pick.

## Session — 2026-04-21 (App shell — Slice 2.5)

Shared app chrome introduced. Each authenticated workspace page
(`/student`, `/tutor`, `/admin`) now renders inside one shell
layout: sticky topbar, footer, and cleaner page bodies.

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam)

- **Single-tier topbar, not topbar+sidebar.** Same pattern MyTeacher
  uses: sticky topbar with logo on the left, middle nav links, user
  controls on the right. Different roles will see different nav
  links when feature pages land. Mobile: hamburger → drawer (scaffold
  only today — nothing to put in it yet).
- **Sidebars are per-feature, opt-in later.** The Bank or Programmes
  may grow sub-navigation sidebars (nested `layout.tsx` under their
  route). Not built today, no plumbing needed now.
- **Topbar mostly empty in the middle today.** No feature pages
  exist yet to link to. As Bank / Programmes / Profile / admin
  sub-routes arrive, links get added here and vary per role.
- **Role switcher moved from inline (bottom of each dashboard) to
  topbar** — now a chip showing the current role that opens a
  dropdown of other roles held. Only rendered for multi-role users.
- **User menu: initials circle** on the far right. Click opens a
  dropdown with name, email, and Sign out (form POST to `/logout`).
  Sign-out button removed from each dashboard body.
- **Route group `(app)`** wraps only the workspace pages. Auth pages
  (`/login`, `/register`), transitions (`/pick-role`, `/router`),
  and dead-ends (`/no-access`) deliberately skip the shell.

### URL impact

None. Route group parens in the folder name don't appear in URLs.
`/student` is still `/student` from the user's perspective.

### Files created

- `mynclex/app/(app)/layout.tsx` — shared shell layout. Fetches
  user, profile, roles, and active-role cookie; passes to topbar.
  Redirects to `/login` if no user.
- `mynclex/app/shell.css` — topbar, dropdown, footer styles.
- `mynclex/components/topbar.tsx` — Server Component, renders the
  topbar skeleton and delegates interactive bits to children.
- `mynclex/components/role-chip.tsx` — Client Component (dropdown
  toggle). Replaces the old bottom-of-page role switcher.
- `mynclex/components/user-menu.tsx` — Client Component (dropdown
  toggle) with sign-out.
- `mynclex/components/footer.tsx` — static footer.

### Files moved

- `mynclex/app/student/` → `mynclex/app/(app)/student/`
- `mynclex/app/tutor/`   → `mynclex/app/(app)/tutor/`
- `mynclex/app/admin/`   → `mynclex/app/(app)/admin/`

### Files modified

- Each role page (`student`, `tutor`, `admin`): stripped the inline
  role badge, inline role switcher, and inline sign-out form. CSS
  imports dropped from page files — layout imports them now. Each
  page keeps its own server-side role check.
- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css`: removed dead `.role-switcher*` and
  `.dash-role-badge` / `.dash-signout-wrap` classes now that the
  topbar owns those concerns.
- `mynclex/app/pick-role/actions.ts`: comment updated to reference
  the topbar role-chip instead of the retired role-switcher.

### Files deleted

- `mynclex/components/role-switcher.tsx` — replaced by the topbar
  role-chip.

### Deferred to future sessions

- **Feature nav links in the topbar** — added per-role as Bank,
  Programmes, Profile, admin sub-sections land.
- **Mobile drawer contents** — scaffolding only today; fills in
  when nav links exist.
- **Active-link highlighting** in the topbar — wire up once there
  are links to highlight.
- **Per-feature sidebars** (e.g. `/bank/*` might get one) — decide
  when the feature is built.
- **Profile link** in user menu — points at `/profile` once that
  page exists.

---

## Session — 2026-04-21 (Auth flow — Slice 2 — role-specific dashboards)

Slice 2 built end-to-end with Claude Desktop (no Claude Web prompt).
Role-specific dashboards now live with per-role server-side guards,
multi-role pick-role page, and an in-dashboard role switcher.

### Decisions (from discussion with Sam)

- **URL shape — Pattern 2 (feature URLs, role-only for authoring areas).**
  Dashboards are role-prefixed (`/student`, `/tutor`, `/admin`) but the
  shared feature pages that arrive later (e.g. `/bank`, `/profile`,
  `/programmes`) will be top-level and render role-adaptive content.
  Tutor/admin authoring pages will still live under `/tutor/*` and
  `/admin/*`. Avoids URL duplication for things that are conceptually
  shared.
- **Multi-role UX — picker + switcher.** First-time multi-role users hit
  `/pick-role`. Subsequent visits honour an `nclex_active_role` cookie.
  A role switcher lives inside every dashboard for cross-over (Sam =
  SUPER_ADMIN + TUTOR).
- **ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN share `/admin` — single route, section-menu
  model (refined 2026-04-21 same-day).** `/admin` is a menu of admin
  sections (sub-routes like `/admin/payments`, `/admin/bank`, etc.).
  SUPER_ADMIN is NOT "ADMIN with a special extras card" — it's a role
  that bypasses the permission engine entirely via
  `nclex_user_has_permission()`'s SUPER_ADMIN short-circuit. ADMIN is
  a trust gate; real capability is governed per-user by rows in
  `nclex_admin_permissions`.
  - **Hide pattern (A1):** ADMIN only sees section cards for permissions
    they hold. SUPER_ADMIN sees every card. Server-side permission gate
    on every sub-route; UI hide is cosmetic, the gate is the real
    security. No separate `/super-admin` route.
  - **SUPER_ADMIN-only sections** (role assignment, config) are
    implemented as permissions that simply never get granted to plain
    admins — no hard-coded super-admin checks in page code.
  - **Empty state:** an ADMIN with zero permissions lands on `/admin`
    with a "No admin sections granted yet — contact your super admin"
    message.
- **Placeholder dashboard content (Decision 3A).** Student and tutor
  dashboards show welcome + "Coming next:" card. `/admin` shows the
  section-menu placeholder described above. Real UI lands as features
  arrive.
- **`nclex_active_role` cookie** — HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, path=/,
  30-day max-age. Read only by server code; never touched by browser JS.
  Per-request validation: the cookie's value must match a role the user
  still holds, otherwise they get bounced to `/pick-role`.

### Files created

- `mynclex/app/dashboards.css` — shared shell styles for all role
  dashboards, `/no-access`, `/pick-role`, plus `.role-switcher*` and
  `.pick-role-*` rules. Replaces the old `dashboard/dashboard.css`.
- `mynclex/components/role-switcher.tsx` — Server Component. Small
  "Switch to" block shown only when the user holds >1 role. Each
  button is its own `<form>` posting to `switchRoleAction`.
- `mynclex/app/pick-role/page.tsx` — the picker screen for multi-role
  users. Single-role visitors are bounced back to `/router`.
- `mynclex/app/pick-role/actions.ts` — Server Action used by both
  `/pick-role` and the role switcher. Validates that the user actually
  holds the requested role before setting the cookie.
- `mynclex/app/student/page.tsx` — student dashboard.
- `mynclex/app/tutor/page.tsx` — tutor dashboard.
- `mynclex/app/admin/page.tsx` — admin section menu (ADMIN + SUPER_ADMIN).
  Badge + view driven by `nclex_active_role` cookie, not role holdings.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/app/router/page.tsx` — new dispatch logic: 0 roles →
  `/no-access`; 1 role → that dashboard; ≥2 roles → cookie or
  `/pick-role`.
- `mynclex/app/no-access/page.tsx` — import path updated to
  `../dashboards.css`.
- `mynclex/middleware.ts` — `AUTH_REQUIRED_PREFIXES` updated. `/dashboard`
  removed (route deleted); `/pick-role`, `/student`, `/tutor`, `/admin`
  added.

### Files deleted

- `mynclex/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `mynclex/app/dashboard/dashboard.css`
- `mynclex/app/dashboard/` folder

### Security posture (Pattern 2 / server-first)

- Every role page fetches the user's roles server-side and `redirect`s
  to `/no-access` if the required role isn't present — guard runs
  before any HTML is rendered.
- The `switchRoleAction` re-checks `nclex_user_roles` before trusting
  whatever role came in from the form — the cookie is never set for a
  role the user doesn't currently hold.
- No business logic in the browser. Forms post straight to Server
  Actions. Cookies are `httpOnly` so browser JS can't read or forge
  them.

### Deferred to future sessions

- **Feature pages** (bank, programmes, profile, classes, curriculum,
  user management) — not in Slice 2's scope.
- **Per-permission gates on admin sub-routes** via
  `nclex_user_has_permission()` — added as each real admin section
  lands (e.g. `/admin/payments` checks `PAYMENTS_REVIEW`).
- **Draft permission list** (not yet a CHECK constraint):
  `PAYMENTS_REVIEW`, `BANK_CURATE`, `TUTOR_VET`, `REPORTS_REVIEW`,
  `USERS_MANAGE`, `CONFIG_EDIT`. Expand as features land. Some
  (`USERS_MANAGE`, `CONFIG_EDIT`) stay SUPER_ADMIN-only by policy.
- **"View as student" / impersonation** for admins — future.
- **Role revocation UI** — admins still edit roles via SQL for now.
- **Cookie writeback on direct URL access.** If a user navigates to
  `/tutor` directly while their cookie says `SUPER_ADMIN`, the cookie
  is not updated. Works fine, just a tiny drift. Revisit if it causes
  confusion.

### Manual step Sam will perform

- After testing, grant SUPER_ADMIN + TUTOR to his account via SQL so
  the multi-role flow can be exercised:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO nclex_user_roles (user_id, role)
  SELECT id, 'SUPER_ADMIN' FROM nclex_users WHERE email = 'mybackpacc@gmail.com';
  INSERT INTO nclex_user_roles (user_id, role)
  SELECT id, 'TUTOR' FROM nclex_users WHERE email = 'mybackpacc@gmail.com';
  ```

### Next session

Slice 3 (password reset + email confirmation), or pivot to first real
feature slice (likely the bank or programmes), at Sam's discretion.

---

## Session — 2026-04-21 (Auth flow — Slice 1 — Claude Web + Desktop)

First Next.js code written for MyNclex. Auth flow Slice 1 complete:
students can register, log in, reach a placeholder dashboard, and
sign out.

### Decisions

- **Server Actions** for register and login (not client-side Supabase
  calls). Idiomatic Next.js, atomic rollback on failure, password
  never exposed beyond the worker runtime.
- **`@supabase/ssr`** wired in with browser / server / middleware clients.
  Clients are functions, not module-scoped instances, per CLAUDE.md rule #4.
- **`getUser()` over `getSession()`** everywhere on the server. Revalidates
  against Supabase's auth server (rule #4).
- **`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`** on all authenticated pages
  (/router, /dashboard, /no-access).
- **Auth rollback:** if profile or role insert fails post-signup, the
  Server Action deletes the auth.users row via service role key.
  Prevents orphan rows blocking re-registration.
- **No email confirmation** — Supabase setting stays off (matches
  Licensure). Flip on before go-live.
- **No-roles → /no-access dead-end.** Safer than auto-assigning a role;
  surfaces bugs rather than masking them.
- **Landing page** swapped from email-capture form to Sign in / Create
  account buttons. Everything else preserved.
- **Single /dashboard placeholder** catches all roles in Slice 1;
  role-specific dashboards come in Slice 2.

### Files created

- `mynclex/lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client.
- `mynclex/lib/supabase/server.ts` — server client (reads cookies).
- `mynclex/middleware.ts` — session refresh + route guards.
- `mynclex/app/register/page.tsx` — register form.
- `mynclex/app/register/actions.ts` — signup Server Action with rollback.
- `mynclex/app/register/auth.css` — shared auth-page styles.
- `mynclex/app/login/page.tsx` — login form.
- `mynclex/app/login/actions.ts` — login Server Action.
- `mynclex/app/router/page.tsx` — post-login traffic controller.
- `mynclex/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — placeholder dashboard.
- `mynclex/app/dashboard/dashboard.css` — dashboard styles.
- `mynclex/app/no-access/page.tsx` — no-roles dead-end.
- `mynclex/app/logout/route.ts` — POST-only sign-out handler.

### Files modified

- `mynclex/app/page.tsx` — landing swap.
- `mynclex/app/landing.css` — added `.cta` button styles.
- `mynclex/package.json` — added `@supabase/ssr`.
- `mynclex/CLAUDE.md` — added Environment variables section.

### Manual steps Sam will perform after Claude Desktop finishes

- Create `mynclex/.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- Add redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard:
  - `http://localhost:3000/**`
  - `https://qacademy-dev-mynclex.mybackpacc.workers.dev/**`
- Register a test account, then run SUPER_ADMIN seed SQL (Claude Web
  will provide).

### Known followups / deferred

- SUPER_ADMIN seed for Sam's account — manual SQL after first signup.
- Email confirmation — flip on in Supabase before real users.
- Password reset flow (`/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) — Slice 3.
- Role-specific dashboards — Slice 2.
- Role-picker UI for multi-role users — Slice 2.
- `nclex_sessions` table for concurrent session control — Slice 3.
- `nclex_auth_events` audit log — Slice 3.
- Wrangler env vars for prod deployment — not yet set.
- Google OAuth — deferred.
- `must_change_password` enforcement flow — deferred.

### Next session

Sam will test the flow end-to-end on dev. Once confirmed working,
next session picks up Slice 2 (role-specific dashboards) or jumps
to another priority at Sam's discretion.

## Session — 2026-04-21 (First build — auth schema, Claude Web + Desktop)

First code written for MyNclex. Auth + roles schema laid down and
applied to the dev Supabase project.

### Decisions

- `nclex_users.id` = `auth.users.id` (UUID PK, standard Supabase pattern).
  Greenfield choice — Licensure/MyTeacher use a separate TEXT user_id +
  auth_id UUID for historical reasons; MyNclex skips that layer.
- Roles stored as rows in `nclex_user_roles` (one row per user-role pair),
  not as an array column. First QAcademy product with real multi-role
  design requirement (Sam = SUPER_ADMIN + TUTOR).
- Permissions stored as rows in `nclex_admin_permissions`. No CHECK
  constraint on permission values yet — deferred until real admin tasks
  surface (per `main.md`).
- Profile creation happens client-side on signup (matches MyTeacher
  pattern). No `auth.users` trigger — avoids cross-product contamination.
- No anon SELECT policy on `nclex_users` — deliberate departure from
  MyTeacher's email-enumeration trade-off.
- Dropped `destination_country` / `destination_region` from the users
  table; will land with Journey Tracker build.

### Columns kept from Licensure/MyTeacher pattern

`forename`, `surname`, `name`, `phone_number`, `avatar_url`,
`must_change_password`, `signup_source`, `last_login_utc`.

### Columns deliberately NOT copied

`username` (unused), `program_id` / `cohort` / `level` (NMC-specific),
`role` as a column (replaced by the separate `nclex_user_roles` table),
`user_id TEXT + auth_id UUID` split (greenfield uses UUID PK directly).

### Files created

- `mynclex/db/schema.sql` — 3 tables, 1 index.
- `mynclex/db/rls.sql` — 3 helper functions, 3 × ENABLE RLS, 10 policies.
- `mynclex/db/README.md` — short entry-point doc.

### Migrations applied

- `mynclex_initial_auth_schema` — tables + index.
- `mynclex_initial_auth_rls` — helpers + RLS policies.

### Helper functions

- `nclex_user_id()` → `auth.uid()`.
- `nclex_user_has_role(role)` → bool.
- `nclex_user_has_permission(perm)` → bool (SUPER_ADMIN passes implicitly).

### Deferred to future sessions

- `nclex_sessions` (concurrent session control) — auth build.
- `nclex_reset_requests` — forgot-password flow.
- `nclex_auth_events` — audit log.
- `nclex_tutor_applications` — "Become a Tutor" public form.
- `nclex_tutor_profiles` — tutor-specific extra fields.
- Manual SUPER_ADMIN seed for Sam's account (runs after register flow exists).

### Next session (continues today)

Sam is driving from Claude web. After this report, he will decide what
to tackle next — likely either the auth flow (register / login /
router / guard) or the basic dashboard placeholders.

---

## Session — 2026-04-20 (Product planning — Claude Web, second long session)

Marathon session. **All 9 MyNclex planning topics now settled.**
Today's work closed the three topics outstanding after the
2026-04-19 session — the bank, curriculum authoring UX, content
sourcing, and the entire student enrolment flow (self-study +
tutored).

### Topics settled today

- **Curriculum Authoring UX** — 14 decisions locked. Programme →
  Week → Module → Activity hierarchy. Six activity block types in
  v1. Weeks view + Calendar view. Up/down arrow reorder. Dual
  publish status (week and module can be Live / Draft
  independently). In-place inline activity picker. Mockups
  produced. See `product-plan/curriculum-authoring-ux.md`.

- **The Bank** — 9 sections covering the full question schema.
  Seven-table structure across QAcademy-owned and tutor-private
  sets. JSONB `content` / `correct` columns. 9 question types in
  v1 (MCQ, TF, SATA, Select N, Matrix, Highlight, Cloze, Drag-drop,
  Bow-tie; Trend deferred). NCSBN-exact scoring via 5 modular
  functions. Case studies with 6 chart tabs and progressive
  unfolding via `visible_from`. Readiness packs as curated
  assessments. 10 filterable classification axes. Per-option
  feedback lives in the `correct` JSONB. See
  `product-plan/bank.md`.

- **Content Sourcing** — reframed as an editorial/business problem,
  out of scope for product build. Bank to be seeded with synthetic
  sample questions for dev/testing. Real editorial work runs off-
  platform led by Sam as a nurse, with vetted nurse educators.
  Two small system decisions taken:
  - No in-platform review workflow — single `is_published`
    boolean.
  - "Report this question" ships in v1 (minimum version). New
    table `nclex_question_reports`.
  Documented in `product-plan/main.md` Content Sourcing section.

- **Self-Study Enrolment** — pay-first model inherited from
  Licensure. Four bank packs (Trial, 30d, 90d, 180d) plus separate
  standalone readiness packs. Dual currency (GHS default, USD
  toggle) via single-row / two-column model on `nclex_products`.
  Currency passed as parameter to a MyNclex-specific payment
  worker. Post-payment: welcome email immediately, cold-start
  dashboard with clear CTAs, "My Payments" page for transaction
  history. Edge cases inherit Licensure behaviour. Documented in
  `product-plan/payments-and-enrolment.md`.

- **Tutored Enrolment** — public programmes list page. Per-
  programme price visibility is a tutor choice via
  `show_price_publicly`. Contact-first flow routes through
  QAcademy as pass-through enquiry (new `nclex_programme_enquiries`
  table). Bundled single-checkout transaction (programme fee +
  subsidised bank), internal split, manual payouts for v1. Auto-
  enrolment on successful payment. No waiting room. Edge cases:
  full/closed programmes visible but not purchasable; soft-stopped
  tutors' programmes hidden; cancellations admin-handled. No
  waitlist in v1. Multiple concurrent enrolments allowed.
  Documented in `product-plan/payments-and-enrolment.md`.

### Revision to earlier decision

- **Programme Structure (2026-04-19) — revised.** Cohort/rolling
  mode distinction removed. Time-gated weekly progress no longer a
  platform behaviour. Content visibility now controlled per-
  activity via Live/Draft status. Rationale: tutors want
  flexibility, not mode-picking. Original decision preserved in
  this session log for audit.

### Schema additions queued for build

- `nclex_products` — full shape locked.
- `nclex_question_reports` — student-reported questions.
- `nclex_programme_enquiries` — contact-first enquiries.
- `nclex_enrolments` — student ↔ programme link.
- `is_published` boolean added to `nclex_bank_items` and
  `nclex_tutor_questions`.
- MyNclex-specific worker: `qacademy-mynclex-payment-worker`
  (dev and prod).

### Planning status — end of day

**9 of 9 topics settled.** Planning phase closed.

### Next session

- Move from planning to build. Suggested order: (1) database
  schema sprint (`nclex_*` tables + RLS), (2) auth setup for
  MyNclex-specific `nclex_users`, (3) public landing page + bank
  products catalogue, (4) self-study pay-first flow (subscribe
  page + payment worker + confirmation page), (5) admin authoring
  flows, (6) tutored flows. Prioritisation to be confirmed in
  next session.

---

## Session — 2026-04-20 (Planning continued — Claude Web + Claude Code)

Three topics settled in one day, with visual reference artefacts for
two of them. Still no code — planning docs only.

### The Bank (Question Bank) — SETTLED

Parallel ownership model (QAcademy-owned + tutor-private, identical
shapes). Seven core tables. All 9 question types ship in v1 (MCQ,
TF, SATA, Select N, Matrix, Highlight, Cloze, Drag-drop, Bow-tie;
Trend deferred to v2). Polymorphic JSONB `content` + `correct`
columns. Per-option feedback in `correct`. Case studies with 6
JSONB chart tabs and `visible_from` unfolding. Readiness packs as a
QAcademy-only product with reserved questions. Five scoring
functions cover all 9 types, NCSBN-exact. 10 classification axes,
all filterable.

Full spec in `product-plan/bank.md`. NGN visual primer saved at
`product-plan/mockups/ngn-primer.html`.

### Curriculum Authoring UX — SETTLED

Unblocked by the bank settlement the same day. Structure hierarchy:
Programme → Week → Module → Activity. Screens: My Programmes
landing, single-screen New Programme form (7 fields), Weeks
Overview with Weeks-view + Calendar-view toggle, Week Builder with
module cards and activity rows, inline 3×2 add-activity picker, six
activity editors (Text, PDF, External link, Live session, Mock,
Practice quiz). Reorder via up/down arrows (drag-and-drop deferred
to v2). Dual publish status (module + week both carry Live/Draft
pills).

Full spec in `product-plan/curriculum-authoring-ux.md`; mockups at
`product-plan/mockups/curriculum-authoring-ux.html`.

### Repo reshuffle

`mynclex/docs/product-plan.md` rebuilt into a `product-plan/`
folder: `main.md` (overview + index), `bank.md`, and
`curriculum-authoring-ux.md` as siblings. Visual HTML references
live in `product-plan/mockups/`. Future topic docs (payments,
registration, etc) slot in as siblings.

### Also settled this session — Content sourcing

Late addition to the planning day. Content sourcing reframed as an
**editorial/business problem, out of scope for product build**. The
bank will be seeded with synthetic sample questions for development
and testing; real content comes later via off-platform editorial
work with vetted nurse educators, led by Sam as a nurse himself.

Two small system decisions taken:
- **No in-platform review workflow.** Single `is_published` boolean
  on questions; reviewing happens off-platform.
- **"Report this question" ships in v1** (minimum version). New
  table `nclex_question_reports`; simple "Dismiss" / "Mark for fix"
  admin queue.

Schema consequences: `is_published` column added to
`nclex_bank_items` and `nclex_tutor_questions`;
`nclex_question_reports` table added.

Documented in `product-plan/main.md` (new "Content Sourcing"
section). `bank.md` cross-references this section.

### MyNclex planning status — end of day

- **8 of 9 topics settled.** Only **Student enrolment flow** remains
  open.

### Next session

- Settle **Student enrolment flow** (signup → programme enrolment →
  bundled bank purchase → Journey Tracker handoff).
- Once that lands, planning is complete and build can begin.

---

## Session — 2026-04-19 (Product planning — Claude Web)

Long planning session to flesh out `docs/product-plan.md` from
skeleton to a usable spec. No code written. Five of the nine planned
topics settled in one sitting.

### Topics settled

- **Roles** — STUDENT, TUTOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN. Users can hold
  multiple roles. No platform-level "programmes" category — NCLEX-RN
  is the only exam. Permission list for ADMIN deferred until real
  admin tasks surface.
- **Journey Tracker** — 7 phases (destination & plan → credential
  evaluation → English proficiency → state board app → exam prep →
  ATT & exam booking → licensure). Phase 7 (migration) deferred to
  v2. Tutor programmes plug into Phase 4.
- **Programme Structure** — week-based, tutor-defined weekly template
  with a default shape, 6 block types in v1, both cohort and rolling
  modes, time-gated progress, mixed auto/tick completion, tutor-
  authored questions private to tutor, co-tutors have identical
  powers.
- **Tutor Onboarding** — Shape 1 vetted marketplace, no public self-
  signup. Public "Become a Tutor" application form storing to
  `nclex_tutor_applications` with status. Vetting off-platform.
  Account creation via admin-triggered setup-link email. Soft-stop
  deactivation. Admin-only deletion.
- **Pricing** — Dual currency (GHS + USD, manual dual pricing, no IP
  detection). Bank as duration packs (30/90/180 days). Readiness
  packs as separate product. Tutor SaaS subscription model (Camp 2),
  flat monthly fee, no payment splits. Tutored students get bundled
  bank access at 50% subsidy, paid to QAcademy directly. Provisional
  numbers anchored (validate before launch).

### Topics still open (from the original nine)

- **The bank** — content structure, question types in v1,
  organisation (topics, difficulty, NCLEX test plan categories)
- **Curriculum authoring UX** — how tutors physically build a week
- **Student enrolment flow** — discovery → payment → start
- **What a tutorial session looks like** on the platform
- **Content sourcing** — where do the initial NCLEX questions come from

### Repo hygiene

- This file created — MyNclex now has its own product-local
  SESSIONS.md, matching MyNMCLicensure and MyTeacher.
- The root `SESSIONS.md` is being retained as a repo-wide milestone
  log only; detailed product work moves to product-local session
  logs.

### Next session

- Pick up one of the five remaining topics. Recommended next: **The
  bank** (content structure + sourcing), as everything else
  (authoring UX, enrolment flow, session UX) depends on the bank
  being understood first.
- Still no code. Design + plan phase continues.


## Loose ends — deferred from Slice 1.11b (2026-04-23)

Items surfaced during Sam's verification of 1.11b on dev that
aren't shipped but shouldn't be forgotten.

### Clear slot button (UX affordance, deferred)

Currently, removing a question from a case requires clearing the
stem manually and saving — the empty-slot filter (commit
`67d656a`) then treats the slot as empty and the server drops the
row. This works but is not discoverable. A dedicated "Clear slot"
button was discussed and deferred. Open UX question: where the
affordance should live (topbar of the right pane, Housekeeping
accordion, or hover-× on the pill were all considered).

### Case wrapper accordion label clash (known temporary)

The left-half case wrapper uses accordion labels Content /
Classification / Housekeeping (from 1.11a). The right-half
`QuestionAuthoringPanel` uses the same three labels for each
child question (from 1.11b). A curator opening a case sees two
sets of identically-named accordions with different meanings on
the same page. This was flagged as a known temporary in the
1.11b handoff; cleanup is a later slice. Likely rename target
for the case wrapper: Case Setup / Case Metadata / Case
Publishing (or similar), so the wrapper accordions read as
case-level rather than question-level.

### Slice 1.11c — next planned focus

Wires up the "Preview as student · position N" button that
already exists as a disabled stub in the case editor's chart
header. When functional, clicking the button toggles the chart
to show only entries where `visible_from <= N` for the chosen
position — letting the curator see what a student on question N
will actually see during the case. Also brings in
validation-summary-style warnings ("Tab X has no entries visible
at position 1", "This case has 4/6 questions; publish requires
all six", "Q3 has no CJMM step selected") that catch authoring
errors before publish. Unblocks clean authoring before the
student runner is built.
