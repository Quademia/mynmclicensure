# MyNMCLicensure Build List

The inventory of slices: everything built, everything queued, everything
parked, one line each, grouped by the plan doc that defines it. Rebuilt
to this shape on 2026-09-10 when the rebuild was planned; the gamma-era
list it replaces is in git history and in `qacademy-gamma`.

## Rules for this file

- **One line per slice:** `- <mark> <id> <name> — <date if built>`.
  Under 120 characters. No explanation, no commit hashes, no merge or
  release status (git holds that).
- **Marks:** ✅ built (with the date) · ⬜ queued · ⏸ parked, with a
  one-line reason · ✖ cancelled.
- **A section per plan doc.** Slice ids are the doc's own ids.
- **Built means ticked in two places in one commit:** here and in the
  plan doc's ladder.
- **There is no "next" marker.** Sam decides each session.
- **Unplanned work still gets a line** when done, marked `(unplanned)`.
- **Found mid-build and out of scope:** a ⬜ line in the right section,
  or a ⏸ line with its reason. Never a paragraph.

## Carried from gamma

Items from the gamma-era list that still apply after the rebuild. Not
rebuild work; listed so they are not lost.

- ⬜ Content: `items_rphn_disease_ctrl` is empty while its course is active
- ⬜ Content: `items_rm_mid` short of its target set count (540 of 900)
- ⬜ Content: set-size targets for RMHN / NACNAP / RPHN
- ⬜ Remove MANUAL_TEST rows before cutover (moot if cutover deletes old data)
- ⏸ Email confirmation on signup — a product change; not in the like-for-like rebuild
- ⏸ Expiry-reminder scan — a Sheets-era admin tool (git 31ccde3) never rebuilt on Supabase; only `expiry_reminded` survived; after the rebuild, needs 10
- ⏸ Admin create user; sessions / auth-events / reset-request audits — new features, after
- ⏸ Student analytics, notifications, search, sequential runner mode — new features, after
- ⏸ Paystack LIVE key on prod — waits on the company / Paystack-account decision

## After the rebuild

Product changes spotted while transcribing `legacy/`. None is built
during the rebuild (AGENTS.md ⭐: no new user-visible feature). One
line each, with the slice that surfaced it; Sam orders them once
cutover is done.

- ⬜ A link to Premium Prep from the landing page — legacy never linked it; the page was shared by address only (slice 3, 2026-09-12)
- ⬜ Learning history: the stats bar counts the loaded pages, not the whole history — legacy called true totals deferred (slice 7a, 2026-09-14)
- ⬜ Learning history: Source and Sort work over the loaded pages only; Course / Mode / Status / Search are database-side (slice 7a, 2026-09-14)
- ⬜ Learning history: no Mock option in the Source filter; a mock attempt’s chip shows the raw word "mock" (slice 7a, 2026-09-14)
- ⬜ Procedures: the thirteen NMC manual links are fixed in the page; move them to a table with an admin management page (slice 7c, 2026-09-14)
- ⬜ Offline packs: the renderer’s cover prints "Prepared for: …" twice, the owner line and the stored label beneath it — legacy did (slice 13a, 2026-09-14)
